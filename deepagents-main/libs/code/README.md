## 🤔 What is this?

The fastest way to start using Deep Agents. `deepagents-code` is a pre-built coding agent in your terminal — similar to Claude Code or Cursor — powered by any LLM that supports tool calling. One install command and you're up and running, no code required.

**What `deepagents-code` adds on top of the SDK:**

- **Interactive TUI** — rich terminal interface with streaming responses
- **Conversation resume** — pick up where you left off across sessions
- **Web search** — ground responses in live information
- **Remote sandboxes** — run code in isolated environments (LangSmith, AgentCore, Daytona, Modal, Runloop, & more)
- **Persistent memory** — agent remembers context across conversations
- **Custom skills** — extend the agent with your own slash commands
- **Headless mode** — run non-interactively for scripting and CI
- **Human-in-the-loop** — approve or reject tool calls before execution

## 🔒 Security model

By default, `dcode` trusts the directory you run it in. Human-in-the-loop approval gates model-requested tool calls, but project artifacts are read before any approval prompt.

Do not run `dcode` in a directory you do not trust without a sandbox backend. For untrusted repositories, use a [remote sandbox](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/deepagents/code/remote-sandboxes) so execution is isolated from your machine. Running `dcode` in a directory lets that directory's files shape execution. See [`THREAT_MODEL.md`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/blob/main/libs/code/THREAT_MODEL.md) for details.

## Managed configuration

Administrators can enforce any supported `config.toml` setting with a read-only
`managed_config.toml` using the same TOML schema:

- macOS: `/Library/Application Support/dcode/managed_config.toml`
- Windows: the `ProgramData` directory reported by the registry, usually
  `C:\ProgramData\dcode\managed_config.toml`. The `%ProgramData%` environment
  variable is ignored, because any user can change it.
- Linux and other supported POSIX systems: `/etc/dcode/managed_config.toml`

Managed values override two lower layers: the `DEEPAGENTS_CODE_` and
compatibility environment variables, and `~/.deepagents/config.toml`.

For an agent launch, managed values also override these CLI flags: the model,
the auto-classifier model, the interpreter toggle, the programmatic tool-calling
list, the recursion limit, the shell allow list, and the startup mode. A managed
`[sandboxes].default` names the backend of a launch that is already sandboxed;
it does not sandbox a launch that asked for no sandbox. A managed startup mode
only revokes `--auto-approve` and `--yolo`; the mode itself reaches the runtime
through the merged configuration, so a headless launch still works. Subcommand
display flags such as `dcode threads --relative` are not overridden.

Tables merge recursively. Deny lists are unioned. An explicitly managed allow or
trust list replaces lower-precedence grants. An empty managed list removes every
lower-precedence grant.

A managed value whose type contradicts the manifest is ignored, and the
lower-precedence value stays in effect. Two exceptions:

- The enforced keys (`startup.mode`, `startup.yolo_switcher`,
  `shell.allow_list`, `skills.extra_allowed_dirs`,
  `interpreter.enable_interpreter`, `interpreter.ptc`,
  `interpreter.ptc_acknowledge_unsafe`, `models.allowed`,
  `models.auto_classifier`, `runtime.recursion_limit`, `sandboxes.default`,
  `tracing.langsmith_redact`)
  stop every command except `config`, `doctor`, `auth path`, and the help
  screens. If one is ignored, the user's flag or environment variable stays in
  force. This grants the escalation, or it removes the boundary that the policy
  declared. Three
  cases stop the launch and block `/reload`: a value the manifest rejects, a
  `runtime.recursion_limit` outside its bounds, and a key shadowed by a scalar
  ancestor (`startup = "manual"` in place of `[startup]` and `mode`). A managed
  `[sandboxes].default` that names an unavailable backend stops a sandboxed
  launch; a launch that asked for no sandbox is unaffected. A scalar at any
  known configuration section (for example, `threads = "bad"` instead of
  `[threads]`) also stops launch and reload rather than replacing the user's
  whole section.
- Inside structured tables (`[models.providers]`, `[themes]`,
  `[async_subagents]`, `[sandboxes.providers]`) the dedicated typed reader
  validates instead, so a wrong-typed managed leaf can displace a valid user
  leaf. The reader then falls back to the built-in default. A managed scalar
  still replaces a colliding user table there, the same as on the top-level
  merge.

`[shell].allow_list` is read from `~/.deepagents/config.toml` and from
`DEEPAGENTS_CODE_SHELL_ALLOW_LIST`, so a managed file can enforce it. A user can
also grant themselves shell auto-approval from their own config file. An empty
managed list removes every lower-precedence grant.

`[models].allowed` narrows dcode to exact `provider:model` specifications:

```toml
[models]
allowed = ["acme:production", "acme:production-fast"]
```

The rules:

- A missing key preserves unrestricted model selection.
- An empty list blocks all local model use.
- A list that dcode cannot parse also blocks all local model use. A typo must not
  silently remove the restriction the user asked for. Fix or remove the key.
- Matching is exact and splits only the first colon, so model identifiers may
  contain additional colons. Matching is also case-sensitive.
- Entries must be fully qualified. A bare model name that you type at a prompt
  is first resolved to `provider:model`, the same as at construction, so
  `gpt-5.6-terra` matches an `openai:gpt-5.6-terra` entry. A bare name whose
  provider dcode cannot infer never matches.
- Write a Bedrock model as `bedrock:<id>`. A bare Bedrock ID is rejected,
  because its version colon would make it a specification that nothing matches.
- The list filters model discovery and the selector. Construction-time checks
  are authoritative for CLI flags, runtime switches, Auto classifiers, rubric
  graders, and explicit local subagent models.
- A managed list replaces a user list. Managed default, recent, and
  Auto-classifier models must also appear in it.
- `[models.providers.<name>].models` registers models additively. It does not
  grant permission, so a custom model may need both registration and an
  allowlist entry.

`dcode` never writes the managed file. Users can still save a preference. The
theme, terminal-mapping, UI-toggle, and MCP-server screens, and the
`--auto-update` flag, report when a managed value keeps a saved preference from
taking effect. The model-default, recent-model, and Auto-classifier writers
refuse a value outside the effective allowlist, and report the policy as the
reason. Other save paths do not check the allowlist.

A missing managed file applies no policy. If one exists but is unreadable, not
UTF-8, or invalid TOML, every command fails closed except the ones needed to
diagnose it: `--help`, `--version`, `help`, `config`, `doctor`, and
`auth path`. A managed file that becomes unusable later also blocks `/reload`:
the session keeps the policy that was in force, and the reload reports that it
kept it. Use `dcode config path` and `dcode doctor` to inspect its
fixed path and parse health; `dcode config` also warns when the file exists but
could not be parsed, or parses and declares a value that cannot be enforced.

A deny list that cannot be read denies everything rather than nothing. This
covers a managed `[mcp].disabled_servers` that is neither an array of names nor
a comma-separated string, and a `[mcp]` section that is not a table. A managed
`[mcp].enabled_project_server_approvals` that is not an array is treated the
same way: the key is present, so policy means to narrow access, and reading its
presence as absence would leave both the user's approvals and the
`DEEPAGENTS_CODE_DANGEROUSLY_ENABLE_PROJECT_MCP_SERVERS` bypass in force.

A corrupt `~/.deepagents/config.toml` does not disable managed policy: the user
file is ignored and managed values still apply.

Deployment tooling must create and protect this file with administrator or root
permissions. `dcode` does not validate the file owner or mode. `dcode` provides
no privileged writer. Deployment and `sudo` policy are the administrator's
responsibility.
