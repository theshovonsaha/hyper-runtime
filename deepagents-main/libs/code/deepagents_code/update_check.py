"""Process-local half of `update_install_lock`.

`update_install_lock` builds a fresh `FileLock(thread_local=False)` per call, so
the cross-process lock alone would not stop two threads in one dcode process
from both entering the install. This guarantees a single in-process holder,
independent of the filelock backend's cross-thread behavior.

`thread_local=False` is required rather than incidental: `_perform_app_upgrade`
holds this lock across `await`s, so acquisition and release are not guaranteed
to happen on the same thread, and a thread-local `FileLock` would refuse to
release on a different one.

    """Try to claim the exclusive right to self-upgrade dcode.

    Startup auto-update, `dcode update`, `/update`, and the update notification
    all replace the same installed package, so concurrently launched terminals
    would otherwise each run their own install against one tool environment.
    Whichever process wins the lock performs the upgrade; the rest keep running
    the version they launched with and pick the new one up on their next launch.

    Non-blocking by design: a loser returns immediately rather than stalling
    startup behind an install it does not need.

    The locking itself never raises; exceptions from the caller's own body
    propagate as usual. When the lock is unusable — an unwritable state
    directory, or a filesystem whose locking the OS refuses — this yields
    `True` and lets the caller proceed unsynchronized. That is the behavior
    from before this lock existed, and it is the fail-open choice: yielding
    `False` there would mean updates never run again on that machine. Only a
    lock genuinely held elsewhere yields `False`.

    Yields:
        `True` while this process may install, `False` when an install is
        already under way — in another process, on another thread, or on this
