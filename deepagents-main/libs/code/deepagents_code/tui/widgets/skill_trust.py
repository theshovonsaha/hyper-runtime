"""Trust prompt for skills that resolve outside trusted skill directories.

When a `/skill:<name>` invocation reads a `SKILL.md` whose resolved path (via
symlink) falls outside every trusted skill root, `load_skill_content` refuses
the read. Rather than forcing the user to quit, edit env/config, and relaunch,
this non-blocking modal asks for an in-the-moment decision. Allowing persists
the resolved target directory to the skill trust store.
