"""Confirmation modal offered when a change needs an owned-server respawn.

Some changes take effect only when the app-owned LangGraph server subprocess
spawns: provider/sandbox extras and `--package` installs are imported at spawn
time, and a Tavily key saved via `/auth` binds the `web_search` tool only at
spawn time. A `/restart` respawns the subprocess without exiting the TUI, so
rather than make the user type `/restart` by hand, this modal offers to run
that restart immediately while leaving deferral one keypress away. The title
`verb` and `body` are caller-supplied so one modal serves each flow.
