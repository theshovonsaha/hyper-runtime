"""Message store for virtualized chat history.

This module provides data structures and management for message virtualization,
allowing the TUI to handle large message histories efficiently by keeping only
a sliding window of widgets in the DOM while storing all message data as
lightweight dataclasses.

The approach is inspired by Textual's `Log` widget, which only keeps `N` lines
in the DOM and recreates older ones on demand.
