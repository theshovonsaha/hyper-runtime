"""Shared paste handling for text-area inputs.

Terminals deliver a paste in one of two shapes: a single bracketed `Paste`
event, or — when bracketed paste is unavailable — a rapid stream of individual
key events. Both the primary chat input and the inline free-text prompts keep a
multi-line paste grouped instead of submitting on the first embedded newline.
Bracketed and detected key-event pastes may additionally collapse into a compact
`[Pasted text #N]` placeholder that expands on submit, and dropped-path payloads
(quoted, or bare paths detected by shape) are routed to path/media handling.

Ordinary typing is never hidden: a rapid run stays in the document until
something confirms it is a paste — an embedded newline, a dropped-path shape, or
a length no human reaches at burst speed — at which point it is promoted into
the hidden buffer.

`PasteBurstTextArea` owns the burst detection and Enter-suppression state
machine, leaving policy (slash-command context, whether collapsing is enabled,
how a flushed payload is handled) to overridable hooks.
`CollapsingPasteTextArea` layers the large-paste collapse + placeholder storage
on top, keeping the full content off-screen until submission.

          paste would never collapse into a placeholder.
