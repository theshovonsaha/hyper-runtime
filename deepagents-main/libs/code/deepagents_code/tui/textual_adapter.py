    """Return the tracked tool rows a nested interrupt's action requests own.

    Used by `_interrupt_tool_rows` for a nested (non-main-agent) checkpoint,
    whose pause/resume must touch only the specific tool calls it carries so
    unrelated outer `task` rows keep running. Because a `HITLRequest`'s
    `ActionRequest` carries no tool-call id, ownership is matched by tool name
    plus argument value-equality (order-independent `dict` comparison). Each
    candidate row is claimed at most once, so two identical calls map to two
    distinct rows.

    Two caveats follow from matching on args value rather than an id:

    - It relies on the human-in-the-loop middleware surfacing the tool call's
        `args` unchanged in the action request (true as of the pinned
        `langchain` middleware). If that ever diverges — normalization, a JSON
        round-trip, redaction — the match degrades silently to returning fewer
        rows; `test_matches_row_by_name_and_args` guards the current contract.
    - A nested action request that happens to share a name and args with a
        concurrently tracked row (e.g. an identical `execute` call at another
        nesting level) can misattribute that row. This is strictly rarer than
        pausing every row and self-corrects, since the same helper drives both
        pause and resume.

    A nested subagent's own child tool call is not tracked in
    `current_tool_messages` — message-stream tool rows are gated to the main
    agent (see the `is_main_agent` check) — so a purely nested interrupt
    normally matches nothing and leaves every outer row untouched, keeping the
    still-running `task` timers monotonic across the checkpoint.

    Args:
        action_requests: The interrupt's action requests (`name` + `args`).
        current_tool_messages: Live map of tool-call id to tracked tool row.
