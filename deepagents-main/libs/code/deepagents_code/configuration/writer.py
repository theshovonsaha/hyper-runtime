    Only the default path is refreshed. `get_config_resolver` is keyed on
    `DEFAULT_CONFIG_PATH`, so reloading it after a write to an override path
    would re-read the real user config and the managed policy file - live
    filesystem reads inside tests that passed a `tmp_path` - while leaving the
    written path's own view stale anyway.

    Refreshes every tier, managed policy included. `reload()` re-reads the
    managed file through `_reload_enforceable_managed_snapshot`, so an in-app
    preference toggle also picks up policy installed since startup. That is
    the price of one generation: leaving the managed provider alone would let
    the user tier advance past the policy tier, which is the split-generation
    state the whole design exists to prevent.

    Failures are logged rather than returned. The write already landed and was
    replaced into place; reporting a stale in-process view as a failed write
    sends the user to retry or hand-edit a file that is already correct.

    Every failure, not just `OSError`: a reload can also raise `ValueError`
    from the snapshot and resolved-value invariants, or `RuntimeError` from a
    provider that produced no snapshot. Callers such as
    `model_config._save_toml_field` invoke this from the success branch of
    their own write and return `bool`, so anything escaping here surfaces as a
    crash after the bytes are already on disk -- the exact outcome the
    paragraph above says must not happen.
