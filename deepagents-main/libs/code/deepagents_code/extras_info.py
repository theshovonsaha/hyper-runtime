    when its source root actually contains the `deepagents` module imported into
    this process.

    Both halves are load-bearing, and they guard opposite errors:

    - Scanning, rather than a single `importlib.metadata.distribution` lookup,
      avoids a false negative. `setuptools` leaves a gitignored
      `deepagents.egg-info/` in the source tree after any local build, and the cwd
      is on `sys.path` for `-c`, `-m`, and the REPL, so that `*.egg-info` is found
      *first* when running from the checkout. It carries no `direct_url.json`, so
      the single-lookup form reports "not editable" and never consults the real
      editable install in site-packages — disagreeing with the SDK's own
      `lc_versions.deepagents` trace entry, which scans.
    - Correlating against the located package avoids a false positive. An
      environment can hold more than one `deepagents` record — a wheel earlier on
      `sys.path` and an unrelated editable checkout later on it. Only the wheel's
      code is actually importable, so reporting the other checkout's root would
      attribute a workspace build to a published install.

    Per-distribution metadata failures are contained by the helpers above, so one
