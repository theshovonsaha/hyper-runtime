"""Estimate and persist cumulative model cost for each thread.

The graph owns the durable total. `CostTrackingMiddleware` writes ordinary graph
deltas, while `prepare_operation_cost` gives server-owned operations a
rollback-safe delta to commit with their state update. Each cost update therefore
rides a graph checkpoint and works for local, headless, and remote execution
without a client-side state update -- the middleware also runs in local
in-process agents, where there is no server and the delta rides the local
checkpoint.
The client is a reader: it renders the streamed total and never maintains its own
lifetime figure.

Coverage is not limited to the agent's own model node. Offload/summarization and
the Auto mode classifier invoke a model directly, outside `after_model`, and
subagents run their own graph. `_SessionCostRecorder` — a callback handler
installed process-wide for every model request (see `_install_recorder`) —
collects one record per *completed* request, keyed by thread, and
`CostTrackingMiddleware` drains and prices those records on the main agent's
checkpoint path. New side invokes are covered with no extra wiring.

The recorder only collects; the middleware alone prices and writes. The agent's
own response is still priced from state, but only when the recorder did not
already charge that message ID, so a request is never counted twice. That
fallback keeps main-agent cost correct even for a model that never fires
callbacks.

Nested agents first checkpoint their own spend on the same private channel.
That makes a completed model call durable before a later tool approval can
interrupt the subgraph. When the subagent finishes, its middleware transfers
the accumulated delta through an owner-scoped state entry. The subagent tool
checkpoints that entry on the parent graph even when a sibling interrupts, while
the private total itself remains isolated between graphs.

Every caller uses `estimate_cost`, the only function that imports or calls
`genai-prices`. The import is lazy so the package and its bundled pricing data
stay off the CLI startup path. On that first successful import a daemon-thread
updater starts refreshing the catalog from upstream hourly (see
`_start_price_updater`); `DEEPAGENTS_CODE_PRICES_AUTO_UPDATE=0` or
`[update].prices_auto_update = false` in `config.toml` opts out, and
`DEEPAGENTS_CODE_OFFLINE` suppresses it along with every other network fetch.
When the active genai-prices catalog -- the bundled data, or the auto-updated
snapshot once one is installed -- has no rates for a model, a local override
catalog is consulted as a fallback-on-miss (see `_override_price`): the user's
own `~/.deepagents/prices.json` first, then a maintainer-curated file shipped
as package data. `PRICING.md` documents the former for users and
`bundled_prices.README.md` the latter for maintainers. Unsupported models and
malformed usage return `None`; pricing must never interrupt a model turn.
