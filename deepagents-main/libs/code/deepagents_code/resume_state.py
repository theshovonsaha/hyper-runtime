"""Schema and middleware for per-checkpoint state restored when resuming.

`ResumeState` declares several checkpointed, schema-private channels. They fall
into two groups with *different* write paths:

Written from inside the graph on successful model turns:

- `_context_tokens` — total context tokens from the latest
    `AIMessage.usage_metadata`, written by `ResumeStateMiddleware.after_model`.
    Powers `/tokens` and the status bar.
- `_model_spec` / `_model_params` — the model and invocation params effectively
    in use for the turn, written by `ConfigurableModelMiddleware` after a
    successful model call. Lets `dcode -r` restore the model the resumed thread
    was actually using instead of falling back to the user's global default.
- `_last_model_request_at` / `_last_cache_model_spec` — UTC request-start time
    and requested model identity captured by `ConfigurableModelMiddleware` and
    committed only after that call succeeds. Lets the TUI detect when the
    provider's reusable prompt prefix may be cold.

Written through the main graph or by the TUI client via `aupdate_state` (see
`DeepAgentsApp._persist_goal_rubric_state`) — these are user/agent-owned. Their
write sites are called out below:

- `_goal_objective` / `_goal_status` / `_goal_rubric` / `_goal_status_note` —
    the accepted goal and its lifecycle status. `_goal_objective`/`_goal_rubric`
    are client-only, but `_goal_status`/`_goal_status_note` are *also* written
    from inside the graph by the agent's `update_goal` tool.
- `_pending_goal_completion_note` — optional agent-provided completion evidence
    awaiting the post-turn rubric result.
- `_sticky_rubric` — the TUI-owned persistent rubric. This is separate from
    the public `rubric` graph input so one-shot rubric turns can be checkpointed
    without being restored as sticky state.
- `_pending_goal_objective` / `_pending_goal_rubric` / `_pending_goal_kind` /
    `_pending_goal_request_id` — a proposed goal or amendment and its originating
    request, written by `GoalCriteriaMiddleware` inside the main graph, then
    cleared by the TUI when the user accepts or rejects it.

All of these are facts the CLI reads back from `state_values` on thread resume
so it can rehydrate the session without replaying or re-tokenizing history.

The model-turn channels are persisted from inside the graph (rather than via a
separate client-side `aupdate_state` call) so the write rides the same checkpoint
as the model response and avoids creating a standalone `UpdateState` run in
LangSmith. Because they are versioned channel state, resuming a specific
checkpoint yields the values as of *that* checkpoint — not a thread-level
aggregate. Accepted goal/rubric state is client-written because the user sets it
outside any model turn; pending criteria proposals and agent-driven status
updates are graph-written. Both paths work identically against local and remote
(HTTP) graphs.

    to `paused` so the notice cannot present a corrupt status as an actionable
    goal, and logging the discard. Both read the vocabulary from
