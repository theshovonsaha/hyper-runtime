`5m` prices Anthropic's five-minute ephemeral write premium. `generic_write`

rate; omitting the detail would price the miss at plain input. The premium's
current magnitude comes from the pricing catalog, not from here. `generic`
covers misses with no write surcharge, which is how OpenAI priced prompt
caching before GPT-5.6.

`generic_write` is assigned by *model-name version* (see
`_openai_uses_thirty_minute_cache`), not by inspecting the catalog, and that
coupling is not enforced: a future 5.6-family model with no published cache
rates would be tagged `generic_write` and priced at plain input by
`estimate_cost`, which drops detail keys the catalog cannot price. Models
carrying no cache rates at all already exist in the catalog, so this is a

the last successful turn, so the cached prefix cannot be reused regardless of
age. `age_unknown` means there is no usable record of when this thread last
reached the model -- a checkpoint written before cold-cache tracking existed,
or one whose timestamp could not be parsed -- so the cache cannot be assumed
warm. Each maps to distinct modal copy; they are not interchangeable, and in
particular `age_unknown` must not be reported as `identity_changed`, which
would claim a model change that never happened.

The identity check compares only these. Comparing whole `model_params` maps

rewrites `reasoning_effort` wholesale, and `temperature` or `max_tokens` are
just as inert for caching -- and the modal would then assert that "the previous
cached prefix cannot be reused" when nothing about the prefix moved. A modal
that fires on a false premise trains users into the permanent suppression.

`cache_control` is deliberately absent: `AnthropicPromptCachingMiddleware`
overwrites `model_settings["cache_control"]` with its own TTL on every
Anthropic request (see `_ANTHROPIC_MIDDLEWARE_TTL_SECONDS`), so a
user-supplied value never reaches the wire. Comparing it would report an

    """Resolve the model name a policy lookup and pricing should use.

    Gateways and proxies read a `provider/model` prefix in the model field to
    route a request to a provider other than the one the wire format implies
    (an OpenAI-format request carrying `anthropic/claude-...`). Such a hop is
    translated between API formats, and translation rewrites or drops the very
    fields a policy assumes (`cache_control`, `prompt_cache_*`), so the
    upstream provider's documented retention no longer describes what happens.

    Any prefix that does not match the wire-format provider is therefore
    treated as a crossing, including prefixes for providers this module cannot
    price -- suppressing a warning is safe, whereas pricing a route whose cache
    semantics were rewritten is not. A matching prefix (`openai/gpt-5.6` in
    OpenAI format) is a same-provider route, forwarded untranslated; the prefix
    is stripped so model-family detection and pricing see the bare name they
    expect.

    The rule is applied wherever the prefix appears, not only on the LangSmith
    gateway: `provider/model` is the naming convention of proxies generally
    (LiteLLM-style deployments included), and those are exactly the endpoints
    this module lets users trust. Scoping it to one known host would leave a
    prefixed name on every other trusted proxy resolving a policy that could
    never be priced -- so the warning silently never fires -- while the
    unstripped name also defeats model-family detection and yields the wrong
    cache minimum. On a provider's official API no legitimate model name
    carries a prefix, so the rule is inert there.

    Args:
        provider: Wire-format provider from the `provider:model` spec. Both
            sides of the comparison are normalized here, so an unnormalized
            value cannot read every prefixed route as a crossing.
