ASK_USER_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """Ask the user one or more questions when you need clarification or input before proceeding.

Each question can be one of:
- "text": Free-form text response from the user
- "multiple_choice": User selects exactly one of the predefined options (an "Other" option is always available)
- "multi_select": User selects one or more of the predefined options (an "Other" free-form option is always available; filling one reveals an "Add another" slot for more custom values)

For "multiple_choice" and "multi_select" questions, provide a list of choices, each with a non-empty "value". For "multiple_choice" the user picks one option or types a custom answer via the "Other" option; for "multi_select" the user toggles one or more of the provided options and may also add one or more custom free-form Other values among the selected values.

A "multi_select" answer is returned as a JSON array of the selected values, e.g. ["a", "b"] (an optional question the user leaves untouched returns []). "multi_select" choice values and custom Other text may themselves contain commas, quotes, and newlines. A "multiple_choice" value is returned on its own with no escaping, so keep that one to a single line.

By default all questions are required. Set "required" to false for optional questions that the user can skip. Do not include "(required)", "(optional)", "- optional", or similar annotations in the question text — the UI renders that separately based on the "required" field.

Use this tool when:
- You need clarification on ambiguous requirements
- You want the user to choose between multiple valid approaches
- You need specific information only the user can provide
- You want to confirm a plan before executing it

Do NOT use this tool for:
- Simple yes/no confirmations (just proceed with your best judgment)
- Questions you can answer yourself from context
- Trivial decisions that don't meaningfully affect the outcome"""  # noqa: E501

ASK_USER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """## `ask_user`

You have access to the `ask_user` tool to ask the user questions when you need clarification or input.
Use this tool sparingly - only when you genuinely need information from the user that you cannot determine from context.

When using `ask_user`:
- Be concise and specific with your questions
- Use multiple choice when there are clear options and exactly one applies
- Use multi-select when the user may legitimately pick several of the options
- Use text input when you need free-form responses
- Group related questions into a single ask_user call rather than making multiple calls
- Never ask questions you can answer yourself from the available context"""  # noqa: E501

    Supports explicit status signaling from the adapter:

    - `answered` (default): consume provided `answers`. An answer count that does
      not match `questions` is rejected as `error` rather than padded or
      truncated, since either would misattribute answers to questions.
    - `cancelled`: synthesize `(cancelled)` answers
    - `error`: synthesize `(error: ...)` answers

    Malformed payloads are converted into explicit error answers instead of
    silently defaulting to `(no answer)`.

        `ToolNode` converts an argument `ValidationError` into an error
        `ToolMessage` before it reaches here, and it logs nothing itself, so
        without this a model sending malformed arguments — or looping on them —
        leaves no operator-visible record at all. The user sees only a red
        `ask_user` row in the transcript.

        The result type is the discriminant: `_ask_user` always returns a
        `Command`, so a `ToolMessage` here means the call never entered the tool
        body. That keeps this off the `_parse_answers` error path, which reports
        a malformed *resume payload* inside a `Command` and logs itself.

        Nothing is caught. An exception from the body must stay fatal, and
        `GraphBubbleUp` from `interrupt()` must keep bubbling.
