"""Lightweight session statistics, token formatting, and usage-table rendering.

Holds `SessionStats`/`ModelStats`, the `format_token_count` formatter,
`print_usage_table` (which imports `rich.table` lazily), and
`usage_table_enabled`, which decides whether that table is rendered at all.
The module is intentionally kept free of heavy top-level dependencies (no
pydantic, no config, no widget imports) so that `app.py` can import
`SessionStats` and `format_token_count` at module level without pulling in the
full `textual_adapter` dependency tree — hence the deferred `config_manifest`
import inside `usage_table_enabled` rather than at the top.

    A request is entered in `recorded_requests` only once usable token metadata
    has been recorded for it. Callers retain that ledger across stream rounds so
    one API call stays one row, however its usage arrives.

    A streamed chunk and a completed message report usage differently, so they
    are handled differently. A completed `AIMessage` carries the request's
    *whole* usage and is idempotent: replaying it must not count twice. A chunk
    carries whatever the provider chose to emit at that point in the stream --
    Anthropic and OpenAI attach the full usage to one chunk, while Google emits
    an incremental delta on every chunk, which the consumer is expected to sum.
    Skipping a chunk whose ID was already seen would drop every Google chunk
    after the first, losing most of the request's output tokens and cost.

    Summing them as separate requests would be wrong in the other direction, so
    a later chunk instead *revises* the request already recorded: its earlier
    contribution is retracted and re-recorded with the running totals. One API
    call therefore counts once, with one per-model row, no matter how many
    chunks carried its usage. Google also names the model only on its final
    chunk, so the model is upgraded when a message supplies one and otherwise
    left alone -- without that, one call would straddle a fallback-model row and
    a real-model row.

    Args:
        stats: Accumulator that receives the request.
        message: Streamed model message or chunk.
        fallback_model: Model to use when response metadata does not name one.
