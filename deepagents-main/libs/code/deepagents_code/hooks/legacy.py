"""Lightweight hook dispatch for external tool integration.

DEPRECATED: This is the legacy hook system, kept for backward compatibility
until September 1, 2026. New integrations should use Hooks v2 — see
`deepagents_code.hooks.loading` for config locations and
`deepagents_code.hooks.models` for the schema. Legacy documents are migrated
to v2 at load time (`deepagents_code.hooks.migration`).

Loads hook configuration from `~/.deepagents/hooks.json` and fires matching
commands with JSON payloads on stdin. Subprocess work is offloaded to a
background thread so the caller's event loop is never stalled. Failures are
logged but never bubble up to the caller.

Config format (`~/.deepagents/hooks.json`):

```json
{"hooks": [{"command": ["bash", "adapter.sh"], "events": ["session.start"]}]}
```

If `events` is omitted or empty the hook receives **all** events.

Onboarding emits `user.name.set` with `{"name": "...", "assistant_id": "..."}`
after the user submits a non-empty preferred name.

`tool.use` fires before a tool call once its streamed arguments parse into a
complete value *and* its tool-call id is known; a call whose arguments never
parse, or that carries no id, is skipped. `tool.result` fires after every tool
call reaches a terminal state — successful execution, failure, or HITL
rejection/cancellation. The three blocks below show the payload *shapes*, not a
single sequence of events:

```jsonc
{"event": "tool.use", "tool_name": "write_file", "tool_id": "toolu_abc123",
 "tool_args": {"file_path": "src/foo.py", "content": "..."}}

{"event": "tool.result", "tool_name": "write_file", "tool_id": "toolu_abc123",
 "tool_args": {"file_path": "src/foo.py", "content": "..."},
 "tool_status": "success", "tool_output": "Updated file src/foo.py"}

{"event": "tool.error", "tool_names": ["write_file"]}
```

`tool_args` is the parsed tool-call arguments; a non-object value (rare) is
wrapped as `{"value": ...}`. `tool_output` is the tool's returned content,
capped to `HOOK_TOOL_OUTPUT_LIMIT` characters (`tool_args` is not truncated); a
capped value ends with `…[output truncated]` so a consumer can tell a truncated
result from a short one.
`tool_status` is `"success"` or `"error"`; `"error"` covers both a tool that
raised and a call the user rejected or cancelled. Whenever a `tool.result` has
`tool_status: "error"`, `tool.error` (payload `{"tool_names": [<name>]}`) fires
alongside it, so existing `tool.error` hooks are unaffected.

`tool_args` is `{}` whenever a `tool.result` cannot be correlated back to a
`tool.use` — either because the call carried no id (then `tool_id` is `null`) or
because no `tool.use` fired for it (e.g. its args never parsed), in which case
`tool_id` may still be the real string id.

Ordering: the tool events (`tool.use`, `tool.result`, `tool.error`) are
dispatched fire-and-forget (see `dispatch_hook_fire_and_forget`) and every
matching hook command runs in its own subprocess. A `tool.use` is *dispatched*
before its `tool.result`, but the two run concurrently, so a hook subscribed to
both may observe them out of order, and events from parallel tool calls
interleave freely. Correlate by `tool_id` rather than relying on arrival order —
there is no cross-event delivery-ordering guarantee for the tool events. Most
non-tool events (`session.start`, `task.complete`, `session.end`, `user.prompt`,
`context.offload`, `context.compact`, `permission.request`) fire in program order.
They are dispatched with an awaited `dispatch_hook`, except `session.end` on the
interactive TUI, which is dispatched via `_dispatch_hook_sync` at shutdown. That
dispatch runs on a worker thread (`asyncio.to_thread`) inside the coordinated
teardown in `app.py` so a slow hook can't block rendering or delay agent
cancellation — it overlaps agent cleanup and server shutdown, and teardown awaits
it before stopping the event loop, so it is dispatched once (never duplicated) and
after every prior non-tool event; the program-order guarantee therefore holds.
Delivery is at-most-once: a force-quit second exit can stop the loop before the
dispatch completes and drop it.
`input.required` and
`user.name.set` are the exceptions with no program-order guarantee:
`user.name.set` is always dispatched fire-and-forget, and `input.required` is
fire-and-forget on the headless surface (awaited only in the interactive TUI).
