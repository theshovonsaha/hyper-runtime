    written. This is the live root for the local-mode `conversation_history`

    never the shared `~/.deepagents` config root -- which also houses
    `config.toml`, `hooks.json`, `.env`, and `.state/`, whose permissions this

    so the whole directory is hardened in that case.

    Note: the `S_ISDIR` check below (which uses `lstat`, deliberately not
    following the link) guards the paths it is applied to -- the
    `conversation_history` subdirectory and, in the fallback case, the temp
    root -- not `~/.deepagents` itself, which is created with a plain `mkdir`.
    So a `conversation_history` (or temp root) that is itself a symlink is
    rejected, whereas a symlinked `~/.deepagents` pointing at a directory the
