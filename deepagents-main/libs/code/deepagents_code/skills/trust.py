"""Trust store for skill directories that resolve outside trusted roots.

`load_skill_content` refuses to read a `SKILL.md` whose resolved path falls
outside every trusted skill root — this stops a symlink inside a skill
directory from reading arbitrary files. The static escape hatch is the
`DEEPAGENTS_CODE_EXTRA_SKILLS_DIRS` env var / `[skills].extra_allowed_dirs`
config allowlist.

This module adds an in-the-moment, persistent approval path: when a skill
resolves outside the trusted roots, the user is asked once to allow the
resolved target directory, and the decision is remembered. Trust is keyed by
the approved target directory — the canonical path resolved and shown to the
user at approval time, stored as-is and never re-resolved.

Two distinct post-approval swaps are caught by two distinct layers, so neither
grants access the user never approved:

* Re-pointing the *discovery* symlink (the `SKILL.md` path) at a new target is
    caught by containment enforcement in `load_skill_content`: the new target is
    not on the allowlist, so the read is refused and the user is re-prompted.
    The stored trust entry — the original resolved target — is untouched.
* Replacing the *stored* directory itself (or one of its parents) with a symlink
    is caught by the `resolve()`-to-self re-verification in
    `load_trusted_skill_dirs`, which drops the stale entry rather than following
    the injected symlink to a directory the user never approved.

Trust entries are app-managed bookkeeping (a set of approved directories), not
user-facing configuration, so they live alongside the other state files under
`~/.deepagents/.state/skill_trust.json` rather than in the hand-editable
`config.toml`.
