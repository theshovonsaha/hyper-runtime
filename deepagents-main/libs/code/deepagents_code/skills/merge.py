"""Shared skill-merge helper with override (name-collision) debug logging.

Both skill discovery paths — the CLI `skills list` loader
(`deepagents_code.skills.load`) and the runtime agent loader
(`deepagents_code.plugins.adapters.skills_middleware.PluginSkillsMiddleware`) —
merge skills from multiple sources by precedence, last-one-wins, keyed on skill
name. A higher-precedence skill replaces a lower-precedence skill with the same
name. That override behavior is intentional; this helper leaves it unchanged and
makes each replacement observable in debug logs.

    Emits one `DEBUG` log whenever a skill replaces an already-merged skill with
    the same name, recording the skill name plus the previous and replacement

    logged when there is no collision.

    skill is always the higher-precedence one.

        source_labels: Parallel accumulator mapping skill name to the label of
            the source that last supplied it; mutated in place so the previous
            label is available on the next collision.
        skill: Skill metadata to merge. Must expose `name`; `path`, when present,
            is included in the override log to identify the colliding files.
        source_label: Human-readable label for the source supplying `skill`,
