    Performs blocking filesystem reads: `ModelConfig.load()` is process-cached,
    but `get_base_url` falls through to the credential store for any provider
    with no `config.toml` `base_url` and no base-URL env var *set* -- the
    default for `anthropic` and `openai`, whose env vars are registered in
    `PROVIDER_BASE_URL_ENV` but normally unset -- and that store re-reads its
    file every call. Callers on the blockbuster-guarded server loop must
    therefore invoke this via `asyncio.to_thread` (see
    `ConfigurableModelMiddleware.awrap_model_call`).

    A spec with no `provider:` prefix cannot name an endpoint, so it resolves to
    the same identity as the provider default. That is preferable to returning
    nothing: `_last_cache_endpoint` is written unconditionally alongside the
    spec and timestamp it describes, and a skipped write would leave the
    previous turn's endpoint paired with this turn's spec.

    The provider is normalized exactly as the reader normalizes it
    (`app._cold_cache_warning_for`). `get_kwargs`/`get_base_url` are
    exact-key lookups, so a spec the user spelled `Anthropic:claude-opus-5`
    would resolve `default` here while the reader resolved the real endpoint --
    a disagreement that never self-heals, because both sides keep recomputing
    their own answer, and every send would report `identity_changed`.

    Never raises. Both call sites run *after* `handler()` has returned, so the
    model call is already made and billed; letting a config-shaped surprise
    (a non-string `base_url` from a `class_path` provider that ignores it, say)
    propagate would discard a paid response over a diagnostic value. Failing to
    the provider default is the same degradation an unreadable checkpointed
    endpoint already gets.
