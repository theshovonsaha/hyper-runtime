    """Create a CLI-configured agent with flexible options.

    This is the main entry point for creating a Deep Agents Code agent, usable
    both internally and from external code (e.g., benchmarking frameworks).

    Args:
        model: LLM model to use (e.g., `'provider:model'`)
        assistant_id: Agent identifier for memory/state storage
        tools: Additional tools to provide to agent.
        mcp_tools: Exact MCP tools within `tools`, used to extend approval policy
            from their protocol annotations.
        sandbox: Optional sandbox backend for remote execution
            (e.g., `ModalSandbox`).

            If `None`, uses local filesystem + shell.
        sandbox_type: Type of sandbox provider
            (`'agentcore'`, `'daytona'`, `'langsmith'`, `'modal'`, `'runloop'`).
            Used for system prompt generation.
        system_prompt: Override the default system prompt.

            If `None`, a system prompt is auto-generated with dynamic context
            interpolated in (model identity, working directory, sandbox vs.
            local execution mode, skills path, and interactive-vs-headless
            guidance).

            !!! warning

                Passing a value here replaces that auto-generated prompt
                entirely — none of the dynamic context above is added, and
                `sandbox_type` and `interactive` no longer influence the
                prompt. Only pass an explicit prompt when you intend to take
                full ownership of the system prompt's content.
        interactive: When `False`, the auto-generated system prompt is
            tailored for headless non-interactive execution, and every stack
            gains terminal-stall recovery middleware (a runtime no-op unless the
            resolved model is Fireworks GLM-5.2). Only the system-prompt
            tailoring is ignored when `system_prompt` is provided explicitly;
            the recovery wiring still applies.
        auto_approve: If `True`, no tools trigger human-in-the-loop
            interrupts — all calls (shell execution, file writes/edits,
            web search, URL fetch) run automatically.

            If `False`, tools pause for user confirmation via the approval menu.
            See `_add_interrupt_on` for the full list of gated tools.
        auto_mode_enabled: Install classifier-backed Auto for local TUI or ACP
            runtimes. Callers must leave this disabled for headless and
            sandbox-backed graphs.
        interrupt_shell_only: If `True`, all HITL interrupts are disabled;
            shell commands are validated inline by `ShellAllowListMiddleware`
            against the configured allow-list instead.

            Used in non-interactive mode with a restrictive shell allow-list
            to avoid splitting traces into multiple LangSmith runs.

            Has no effect when `auto_approve` is `True` (interrupts are already
            disabled) or when `shell_allow_list` is `SHELL_ALLOW_ALL`.
        shell_allow_list: Explicit restrictive shell allow-list forwarded from
            the CLI process. When provided (and `interrupt_shell_only` is
            `True`), used directly instead of reading `settings.shell_allow_list`
            (which may not be set in the server subprocess environment).
        fs_tools: Allowlist of filesystem tools to expose to the agent, from
            `--allow-fs-tools`. `None` (default; also what `--allow-fs-tools
            all` parses to) leaves `FilesystemMiddleware` at its SDK default
            (all tools). An explicit list (which must include `"read_file"`)
            installs a `FilesystemMiddleware` restricted to those tool names,
            replacing the SDK's default for the main agent and every synchronous
            subagent (including `general-purpose`) as well as the nested
            goal-criteria agent, so delegation cannot bypass the restriction.
            Async subagents are unaffected (they run on their own remote
            backend, not the local filesystem).
        enable_ask_user: Enable `AskUserMiddleware` so the agent can ask
            clarifying questions.

            Non-interactive callers without a resume loop must explicitly pass
            `enable_ask_user=False`.
        enable_memory: Enable `MemoryMiddleware` for persistent memory
        memory_auto_save: When `True` (default), the memory prompt tells the
            agent to proactively persist learnings to the `AGENTS.md` sources.

            When `False`, memory is still loaded into context but the read-only
            prompt is used instead, so the agent does not auto-save; explicit
            saves (e.g. the `remember` skill) still work.

            No effect when
            `enable_memory` is `False`.
        enable_skills: Enable `SkillsMiddleware` for custom agent skills
        enable_shell: Enable shell execution via `LocalShellBackend`
            (only in local mode). When enabled, the `execute` tool is available.
        enable_interpreter: Wire `CodeInterpreterMiddleware` from
            `langchain-quickjs` into the main agent.

            Local-mode only — passing a non-`None` `sandbox` while
            `enable_interpreter=True` raises `ValueError`. Subagents do not
            receive the interpreter in v1.

            PTC (`tools.*` host bridge) calls bypass `interrupt_on`/HITL
            approval, so `settings.interpreter_ptc` is the only effective
            control over which host tools can be invoked from inside the
            REPL. `js_eval` itself is intentionally not gated by HITL —
            per-call approval would be unusably noisy and would not block
            PTC fan-out anyway. The `"safe"` preset is therefore restricted
            to tools that are already non-HITL outside the REPL (read-only
            file inspection); exposing HITL-gated tools — network fetch,
            subagent dispatch, shell, file writes — requires an explicit
            list or `interpreter_ptc="all"` with
            `interpreter_ptc_acknowledge_unsafe=True`.

            Requires the core `langchain-quickjs` dependency.
        rubric_model: Grader model for `RubricMiddleware`.

            A `'provider:model'` string or `BaseChatModel`.

            When `None`, the main `model` is reused.
        rubric_max_iterations: Explicit grader iterations per rubric attempt
            before the agent terminates with `'max_iterations_reached'`; `None`
            uses the SDK default.
        auto_classifier_model: Model the Auto approval classifier reviews with.

            A `'provider:model'` string or `BaseChatModel`.

            When `None`, `DEEPAGENTS_CODE_AUTO_CLASSIFIER_MODEL` is consulted,
            then `[models].auto_classifier`, and the main `model` is reused when
            both are unset. A blank string is *not* the same as `None`: it means
            "inherit the main model" directly and, unlike `None`, does not
            consult the env var or `config.toml`. Only meaningful when
            `auto_mode_enabled` is `True`.
        recursion_limit: Explicit LangGraph `recursion_limit` (graph step budget)
            for the main agent. When `None`, it is resolved from the
            `DEEPAGENTS_CODE_RECURSION_LIMIT` env var, `[runtime].recursion_limit`
            in `config.toml`, then the default via `resolve_recursion_limit`.
        checkpointer: Optional checkpointer for session persistence.
            When `None`, the graph is compiled without a checkpointer.
        store: Optional LangGraph Store for runtime approval state.
        mcp_server_info: MCP server metadata to surface in the system prompt.
        cwd: Override the working directory for the agent's filesystem backend
            and system prompt.
        project_context: Explicit project path context for project-sensitive
            behavior such as project `AGENTS.md` files, skills, subagents, and
            MCP trust.
        async_subagents: Remote LangGraph deployments to expose as async subagent tools.

            Loaded from `[async_subagents]` in `config.toml` or passed directly.
        goal_criteria_tools: External read-only context tools available to server-side
            goal criteria generation. `None` disables goal criteria requests.
        rubric_grader_tools: External read-only context tools available to rubric
            grading for verifying work completed in MCP-backed or web-accessible
            systems.
        enforce_model_policy: Check every model string against `models.allowed`.
            Pass `False` **only** from callers that compile a graph they never
            invoke (tool enumeration), so a blocked subagent model degrades the
            listing rather than raising. Any caller that can run the graph must
            leave this `True`.

    Returns:
        2-tuple of `(agent_graph, backend)`

            - `agent_graph`: Configured LangGraph Pregel instance ready
                for execution
            - `composite_backend`: `CompositeBackend` for file operations

    Raises:
        ValueError: When `enable_interpreter=True` is paired with a
            non-`None` `sandbox`, when `settings.interpreter_ptc` contains
            unknown tool names, or when `interpreter_ptc="all"` is used
            without `auto_approve` or `interpreter_ptc_acknowledge_unsafe`.
        ModelNotAllowedError: When `model`, `auto_classifier_model`,
            `rubric_model`, or a subagent's frontmatter `model` is a string
            outside the effective `models.allowed` policy. Model *strings* are
            checked here because the SDK resolves them through
            `init_chat_model`, bypassing `config.create_model`; a prebuilt
            `BaseChatModel` came from a path that already checked.
