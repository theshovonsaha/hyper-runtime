"""Non-interactive execution mode.

Provides `run_non_interactive` which runs a single user task against the
agent graph, streams results to stdout, and exits with an appropriate code.

The agent runs inside a `langgraph dev` server subprocess, connected via
the `RemoteAgent` client (see `server_manager.server_session`).

Shell commands are gated by an optional allow-list (`--shell-allow-list`):

- Not set → shell disabled, all other tool calls auto-approved.
- `recommended` or explicit list → shell enabled, commands validated
    against the list; non-shell tools approved unconditionally.
- `all` → shell enabled, any command allowed, all tools auto-approved.

An optional quiet mode (`--quiet` / `-q`) suppresses stream-time diagnostics
(the tool-call and file-operation notifications) so stdout carries only the
agent's response text.

    The agent is created with `interactive=False`, which tailors the system
    prompt for autonomous headless execution (no clarification questions,
    reasonable assumptions).

    Shell access and auto-approval are controlled by `--shell-allow-list`:

    - Not set → shell disabled, all other tools auto-approved.
    - `recommended` or explicit list → shell enabled, commands gated by
        allow-list; non-shell tools approved unconditionally.
    - `all` → shell enabled, any command allowed, all tools auto-approved.

    Note: startup header rendering avoids synchronous LangSmith URL lookups.
    A background thread resolves the thread URL concurrently and the result is
    displayed after task completion if available.

    Args:
        message: The task/message to execute.
        assistant_id: Agent identifier for memory storage.
        model_name: Optional model name to use.
        model_params: Extra kwargs from `--model-params` to pass to the model.

            These override config file values.
        sandbox_type: Type of sandbox (`'none'`, `'agentcore'`,
            `'daytona'`, `'langsmith'`, `'modal'`, `'runloop'`).
        sandbox_id: Optional existing sandbox ID to reuse.
        sandbox_snapshot_name: Snapshot (langsmith) or blueprint (runloop) name.
        sandbox_setup: Optional path to setup script to run in the sandbox
            after creation.
        initial_skill: Optional skill name whose `SKILL.md` instructions wrap
            the user message before sending it to the agent.
        startup_cmd: Shell command to run at startup, before the agent runs.

            Output follows the same console routing as other app messages:
            stdout by default, stderr when `-q` is set. Non-zero exits and
            timeouts warn but do not abort the task.
        profile_override: Extra profile fields from `--profile-override`.

            Merged on top of config file profile overrides.
        quiet: When `True`, all console output (headers, status messages,
            tool notifications, HITL decisions, errors) is redirected to
            stderr so that only the agent's response text appears on stdout.
        stream: When `True` (default), text chunks are written to stdout
            as they arrive.

            When `False`, the full response is buffered and written to stdout in
            one shot after the agent finishes.
        mcp_config_path: Optional path to MCP servers JSON configuration file.
            Merged on top of auto-discovered configs (highest precedence).
        no_mcp: Disable all MCP tool loading.
        trust_project_mcp: When `True`, allow project-level stdio MCP
            servers. When `False` (default), project stdio servers are
            silently skipped.
        enable_interpreter: Enable the JS interpreter (`js_eval`) middleware
            on the main agent. `None` uses the sandbox-aware default.
        interpreter_ptc: Override for `settings.interpreter_ptc` (PTC
            allowlist for `js_eval`).
        interpreter_ptc_acknowledge_unsafe: Explicit acknowledgement for
            `interpreter_ptc="all"` outside of `auto_approve`.
        allow_fs_tools: Allowlist for `FilesystemMiddleware`'s `tools` param,
            from `--allow-fs-tools`.

            `None` leaves the SDK default (all tools).
        max_turns: Optional cap on total agentic turns. When `None`, the
            internal safety default applies.
        rubric: Acceptance criteria for `RubricMiddleware`. When provided, the
            agent self-evaluates against it and loops until satisfied.

            `None` disables rubric grading.
        rubric_model: Grader model spec; `None` reuses the main model.
        rubric_max_iterations: Grader iterations per rubric attempt; `None`
            uses the middleware default.
        recursion_limit: Explicit main-agent `recursion_limit`; `None` resolves
            from env / `config.toml` / default at agent-build time.
        trust_project_hooks: When `True`, load project-scoped
            `.deepagents/hooks.json` handlers.

            Defaults to `False` so untrusted repositories cannot execute hook
            commands without an explicit `--trust-project-hooks` opt-in.

    Returns:
        Exit code: 0 for success or an intentional hook stop, 1 for error, 124
            when the `--max-turns` budget was exceeded (matching GNU `timeout`),
            130 for keyboard interrupt.
