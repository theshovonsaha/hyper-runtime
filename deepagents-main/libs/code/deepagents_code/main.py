    The other problems `_auto_classifier_spec_problem` detects are advisory:
    launch proceeds and the Auto middleware fails closed per-action. A blocked
    spec is different -- `create_cli_agent` raises on it -- so forwarding it
    after printing a warning would kill the session the warning was about. The
    runtime model has already been checked against the same policy, making it a
    safe fallback.

    Args:
        spec: The resolved classifier spec, the inherit sentinel, or `None`.

    Returns:
        `spec` unchanged when it is usable, otherwise `INHERIT_CLASSIFIER_MODEL`.

    `/auto model` validates by constructing the model and refuses a spec it
    cannot build. The startup surfaces — `--auto-classifier-model`, the env var,
    `[models].auto_classifier` — reached the middleware unchecked, so a typo was
    announced as the active reviewer and only surfaced as a denied tool call
    mid-turn.

    This is the cheap half of what the slash command does: check the spec
    against `models.allowed`, then parse it and check the provider's
    credentials. It deliberately does not call `create_model`, which would pull
    LangChain onto the launch path (see `AGENTS.md`), so it catches the three
    common mistakes — a policy-blocked model, an unknown provider, and a
    missing credential — and leaves the rest to the middleware's fail-closed
    path. The policy check runs first: it is the only one whose failure the
    caller must act on rather than merely report, because a blocked classifier
    would otherwise abort agent construction.

    Args:
        assistant_id: Agent identifier for memory storage.
        approval_mode: Initial `manual`, `auto`, or `yolo` mode.
        auto_approve: Compatibility input for callers using the previous Boolean
            API. `True` maps to unrestricted `yolo`.
        sandbox_type: Type of sandbox
            ("none", "agentcore", "modal", "runloop", "daytona", "langsmith")
        sandbox_id: Optional existing sandbox ID to reuse.
        sandbox_snapshot_name: Snapshot (langsmith) or blueprint (runloop) name.
        sandbox_setup: Optional path to setup script to run in the sandbox
            after creation.
        model_name: Optional model name to use
        model_params: Extra kwargs from `--model-params` to pass to the model.

            These override config file values.
        profile_override: Extra profile fields from `--profile-override`.

            Merged on top of config file profile overrides.
        thread_id: Thread ID for the session.

            `None` when `resume_thread` is provided (the TUI resolves the final
            ID asynchronously).
        resume_thread: Raw resume intent from `-r` flag.

            `'__MOST_RECENT__'` for bare `-r`, a thread ID string for `-r <id>`,
            or `None` for new sessions.

            Resolved asynchronously inside the TUI.
        initial_prompt: Optional prompt to auto-submit when session starts
        initial_skill: Optional skill name to invoke when the session starts.
        initial_goal: Optional goal objective to draft criteria for when the
            session starts.
        startup_cmd: Shell command to run at startup before the first prompt.

            Output is rendered in the transcript; non-zero exits warn but
            do not abort the session.
        mcp_config_path: Optional path to MCP servers JSON configuration file.

            Merged on top of auto-discovered configs (highest precedence).
        no_mcp: Disable all MCP tool loading.
        trust_project_mcp: Controls project-level server trust (stdio and
            remote alike).

            `True` to allow, `False` to deny, `None` to fall back to the
            user's per-server scoped approvals (equivalent to `False` for the
            whole-config decision).
        hook_trust: Policy deciding which workspaces may run project-scoped hook
            commands. `None` consults only the persisted trust store.
        enable_interpreter: Enable `CodeInterpreterMiddleware` (`js_eval`) on
            the main agent. `None` defers to the sandbox-aware/config default.
        interpreter_arg: The raw `--interpreter`/`--no-interpreter` tri-state,
            forwarded so the app can tell an explicit opt-out from a
            sandbox-suppressed default when surfacing the disabled-by-sandbox
            advisory.
        interpreter_ptc: Override for `settings.interpreter_ptc` (PTC allowlist
            for `js_eval`).
        interpreter_ptc_acknowledge_unsafe: Explicit acknowledgement for
            `interpreter_ptc="all"` outside of `auto_approve`.
        allow_fs_tools: Allowlist for `FilesystemMiddleware`'s `tools` param,
            from `--allow-fs-tools`.

            `None` leaves the SDK default (all tools).
        auto_classifier_model: Model spec the Auto approval classifier reviews
            with, from `--auto-classifier-model`.

            `None` resolves from env / `config.toml` and then reuses the main
            agent model. A blank string means the flag was explicitly supplied
            with no value: it overrides any env / `config.toml` classifier so
            reviews inherit the main agent model.
        recursion_limit: Explicit main-agent `recursion_limit`; `None` resolves
            from env / `config.toml` / default at agent-build time.

    Returns:
        An `AppResult` with the return code and final thread ID.

def apply_stdin_pipe(args: argparse.Namespace) -> None:
    r"""Read piped stdin and merge it into the parsed CLI arguments.

    When stdin is not a TTY (i.e. input is piped), reads all available text
    and applies it to the argument namespace. If stdin is a TTY or the piped
    input is empty/whitespace-only, the function returns without modifying
    `args`. Leading and trailing whitespace is stripped from piped input.

    - If `non_interactive_message` is already set (`-n`), prepends the
        piped text to it (the CLI still runs non-interactively):

        ```bash
        cat context.txt | dcode -n "summarize this"
        # non_interactive_message = "{contents of context.txt}\n\nsummarize this"
        ```

    - If `initial_prompt` is already set (`-m`, but not `-n`), prepends
        the piped text to it (the CLI still runs interactively):

        ```bash
        cat error.log | dcode -m "explain this"
        # initial_prompt = "{contents of error.log}\n\nexplain this"
        ```

    - If `initial_skill` is already set (`--skill`, but not `-n`/`-m`) and the
        pipe was auto-detected (no explicit `--stdin`), stores the piped text in
        `initial_prompt` so the skill receives it as the seed for the
        interactive TUI:

        ```bash
        cat diff.txt | dcode --skill code-review
        # initial_prompt = "{contents of diff.txt}"
        ```

        When `--stdin` is passed explicitly, this convenience is skipped: the
        piped text falls through to `non_interactive_message` so the skill runs
        headless (see below):

        ```bash
        cat diff.txt | dcode --skill code-review --stdin
        # non_interactive_message = "{contents of diff.txt}"
        ```

    - Otherwise, sets `non_interactive_message` to the piped text, causing
        the CLI to run non-interactively with it as the prompt:

        ```bash
        echo "fix the typo in README.md" | dcode
        # non_interactive_message = "fix the typo in README.md"
        ```
