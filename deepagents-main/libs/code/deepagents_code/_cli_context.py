middleware stack.

INHERIT_CLASSIFIER_MODEL = "__dcode_inherit_classifier__"
"""Per-run `classifier_model` value meaning "review with the main agent model".

An absent (or `None`) `classifier_model` only says the run carries no
preference, so the classifier keeps whatever the server resolved at startup
(`--auto-classifier-model`, `DEEPAGENTS_CODE_AUTO_CLASSIFIER_MODEL`,
`[models].auto_classifier`). `/auto model clear` needs the stronger statement
that reviews go back to the main agent model, which this sentinel carries.

It cannot collide with a real spec: `create_model` resolves `provider:model`
(or a bare model name) and has no provider or model named `__dcode_...`. A
control character such as a leading NUL would also be collision-proof, but this
value has to survive the trip to a remote deployment intact — the context is
serialized to JSON and may be persisted, and Postgres `text`/`jsonb` rejects NUL
outright. A stripped sentinel would silently read as "no preference" and leave a
startup classifier authorizing actions after the UI reported the clear, so the
sentinel stays plain ASCII.
