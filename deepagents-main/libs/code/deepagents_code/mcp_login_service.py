"""UI-agnostic helpers for resolving an MCP login target.

The MCP login flow historically inlined config discovery, trust gating,
shape validation, and `print()`-based error reporting. The TUI cannot
consume those print statements, so this module extracts the same logic
into pure functions that return structured results (`ConfigResolution`,
`ServerSelection`) plus a typed `ConfigResolutionError`. Callers decide
how to render those results.

No `print()` calls live in this module. No imports happen at module
top level beyond `dataclasses`/`typing`/`pathlib` so the CLI fast path
stays cheap; the actual config loaders are imported inside the
functions that need them.
