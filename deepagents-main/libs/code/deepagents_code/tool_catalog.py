"""Enumerate the tools available to the agent.

Backs two entry points: the `dcode tools list` CLI command (`_run_tools_list`)
and the interactive `/tools` slash command (`app._handle_tools_command`).

The tool set is read from the *real* tool objects the agent binds rather than a
hand-maintained catalog, so names and descriptions never drift from what the
model actually sees. Built-in tools are collected by compiling the agent with a
throwaway offline chat model (no credentials, no network) and reading the bound
tool node; MCP tools are discovered via the same path the app and server use.

The collection functions here lazily import the heavy agent stack (agent
compilation, MCP discovery) inside their bodies. Only the fake-model base is
imported at module top, so importing this module is cheap relative to the agent
stack — and this module is itself imported lazily by both entry points
(`_run_tools_list` and `_handle_tools_command`), never on the startup hot path.
