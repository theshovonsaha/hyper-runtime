"""Shared streaming tool-call buffering and hook-payload construction.

Both execution surfaces reassemble the same streamed tool-call state and fire
the same `tool.use` / `tool.result` / `tool.error` hook payloads:

- the interactive Textual TUI (`deepagents_code.tui.textual_adapter`), and
- the headless runner (`deepagents_code.client.non_interactive`).

This module holds the single implementation of the buffering, argument parsing,
and payload-shape logic, so the two surfaces cannot drift *in those layers*. The
dispatch, gating, result-correlation, and buffer-lifecycle layers are still
implemented separately in each surface (each calls
`dispatch_hook_fire_and_forget` from its own namespace — the dispatch seam tests
patch) and must be kept in sync by hand.

Why the split exists
--------------------

The two surfaces have fundamentally different object lifecycles, which prevents
a single shared dispatch function:

- **TUI**: tool calls are backed by `ToolCallMessage` widgets that persist
    parsed args as instance state and render success/error visually. `tool.use`
    fires at widget-mount time because that is when the parsed args are available
    — they are what the widget is constructed with (or come from a validated HITL
    interrupt). Result correlation reads args from `tool_msg.args` (a widget
    property).

- **Headless**: there are no widgets. Tool-call state lives in a plain dict on
    `StreamState` (`in_flight_tool_calls`, keyed by tool-call id). `tool.use`
    fires in the stream loop once args parse and the tool-call id is known.
    Result correlation pops the record from that dict.

Additionally, only the TUI has interactive HITL approval *widgets* that can be
rejected before any `ToolMessage` streams back, so only it needs
`_dispatch_terminal_tool_result_hooks` and the `completed_tool_result_ids`
duplicate-suppression set for synthetic middleware `ToolMessage` re-arrivals
after a resumed turn. The headless runner *does* have a HITL interrupt/resume
flow, but it never pre-dispatches terminal hooks before a resume — a rejection
arrives as a synthetic `ToolMessage` handled by the normal result path — so
there is no already-emitted terminal hook to suppress and therefore no
equivalent race.

Unifying these into a single function would require either a common
widget-or-dict abstraction (indirection with no behavioral gain) or pushing
widget-aware logic into this shared module (coupling headless mode to TUI
concepts it does not use). The split is deliberate: share everything that *can*
drift (payload shapes, arg parsing, status normalization, output truncation, and
the end-of-stream classification of tool calls that never emitted a `tool.use`)
here, and keep everything that *must* differ (when to dispatch, where args come
from, HITL handling) in each surface.

Parity contract for hook consumers
----------------------------------

A hook consumer can rely on these guarantees being identical across surfaces:

- **Payload shape**: every `tool.use`, `tool.result`, and `tool.error` payload
    is built by the shared builders in this module, so field names and
    truncation are the same.
- **Event completeness**: every executed tool emits `tool.result`, including
    tools whose args never parsed or that carried no tool-call id (both surfaces
    emit with `{}` args in that case). A tool whose stream is aborted before its
    result — a cancelled turn or a mid-stream error — is also closed with a
    terminal `tool.error`/`tool.result` (TUI via
    `_dispatch_terminal_tool_result_hooks`, headless via
    `_dispatch_orphaned_tool_result_hooks`), so no `tool.use` is left dangling.
- **Fire-once-per-id**: `tool.use` fires at most once per tool-call id on both
    surfaces, each gated by a monotonic id set that is never discarded within a
    turn (TUI via `displayed_tool_ids`, headless via `emitted_tool_use_ids`). A
    redelivery of the same id's arg chunks *after* its result — non-standard for
    `stream_mode="messages"` — is therefore ignored on both surfaces rather than
    re-firing `tool.use`. Headless additionally keeps `in_flight_tool_calls` for
    result correlation and the orphan drain; that map *is* cleared per result,
    so it is deliberately not the fire-once guard.
- **`tool.error` co-firing**: whenever `tool_status` is `"error"`, both
    surfaces emit `tool.error` alongside `tool.result`.

What is allowed to differ (and is not part of the contract):

- **Dispatch timing**: the TUI dispatches `tool.use` at widget mount;
    headless dispatches it in the stream loop once args parse. A hook subscriber
    should not assume `tool.use` fires at an identical point in the surface's
    internal lifecycle — only that it fires before `tool.result` for the same
    `tool_id`.
- **HITL rejection events**: both surfaces emit `tool.error`/`tool.result` for
    a rejected tool, but by different routes. Headless (and the TUI on a resumed
    turn) emits them from the synthetic `ToolMessage` on the normal result path;
    the TUI *additionally* emits them via the dedicated
    `_dispatch_terminal_tool_result_hooks` drain for tools rejected or cancelled
    in the interactive UI *before* any `ToolMessage` streams back. Only that
    pre-`ToolMessage` terminal drain is TUI-only — headless has no interactive
    approval path that can reject a call before its result arrives.
- **`ask_user` body sanitization**: the TUI replaces the `tool_output` of an
    answered `ask_user` `tool.result` with a fixed summary constant, so user-typed
    answers are never forwarded to hook scripts; headless would dispatch the raw
    transcript from the `ToolMessage`. Unobservable today because headless sets
    `enable_ask_user=False` and so never produces one — which is precisely why the
    divergence is safe. Enabling `ask_user` headlessly requires porting that
    sanitization first.

When changing the dispatch or gating logic in one surface, verify the parity
contract still holds against the other surface.
