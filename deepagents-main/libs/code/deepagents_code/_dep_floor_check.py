"""Best-effort runtime dependency floor check for editable dev installs.

Editable installs resolve dependencies once at install time and nothing
re-checks them afterwards, so after `pyproject.toml` floors are bumped on
`main` a stale editable venv silently runs new source against old deps.
This module detects editable installs via PEP 610 metadata and warns at
startup when an installed runtime dependency is older than the floor the
checkout declares. Released installs (uv tool / PyPI wheel) carry no
editable `direct_url.json` record and skip the check entirely, so end
users pay no startup cost here.

Interactive launches on a terminal stop on a blocking pre-TUI prompt
(refresh / continue / mute / abort); headless launches, subcommands, and interactive
launches whose stdin is piped get a single stderr warning per launch instead,
since they have no answerable prompt and must never block. A dismissed
(muted) mismatch is remembered per checkout as a fingerprint of the offending
distributions and stays silent until the mismatch itself changes.
