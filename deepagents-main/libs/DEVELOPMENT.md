# Development

Starting point for working in the Deep Agents monorepo. For how the code is structured at runtime, see [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

> Before opening a pull request, read the [LangChain contributing guide](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/contributing/overview). External PRs must link to an issue or discussion that a maintainer has approved, and the contributor must be assigned to it before the PR is opened.

## Prerequisites

- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — manages interpreters, virtual environments, and dependencies. Do not use `pip`, `poetry`, or `conda`.
- `make` — task runner. Every package's `Makefile` is the source of truth for its commands; run `make help` in any package directory to list targets.

`uv` provisions the right Python interpreter automatically, so there is no global Python version to install or pin.

## Quickstart

Pick the package you are changing, install its dependencies, and use its `Makefile` for the normal edit-test-lint loop:

```bash
uv tool install pre-commit
pre-commit install --install-hooks
cd libs/deepagents
uv sync --all-groups
make test
make lint
```

Use `make help` inside any package to see its supported targets. To run a repo-wide check, move to `libs/` and use the fan-out targets, for example `make lint` or `make lock-check`.

## Repository layout

This is a monorepo of independently versioned packages under `libs/`:

```txt
libs/
├── deepagents/     # Core SDK — create_deep_agent, middleware, backends
├── acp/            # Agent Client Protocol integration
├── evals/          # Evaluation suite and Harbor integration
├── code/           # Prebuilt coding agent for interactive and headless use
├── talon/          # Local runtime host for long-running agents
└── partners/       # Provider/sandbox integrations
    ├── daytona/
    ├── modal/
    ├── vercel/
    ├── runloop/
    └── quickjs/
```

Each package has its own `pyproject.toml`, `Makefile`, and `README.md`. There is no root `pyproject.toml`; you work inside the package you are changing. Local package dependencies are editable, so changes in one package are visible to sibling packages that depend on it during development.

## Setup

Work inside the package you are changing. `uv` creates and manages the virtual environment for you — no manual `activate` needed.

```bash
cd libs/deepagents
uv sync --all-groups      # install the package + all dependency groups
```

Prefer the package's `make` targets for standard workflows; use `uv run ...` for direct one-off commands.

Four rules for this monorepo:

- Install dependencies explicitly with `uv sync` (add `--group <name>` or `--all-groups` as needed). Never let them install implicitly.
- Do not create a virtual environment outside the package directory.
- Do not mix environments within one session.
- Each package sets its own supported Python range in `pyproject.toml`. Do not pin a global Python version; defer to the package's `requires-python`.

## Common commands

Run these from inside a package directory (e.g. `libs/deepagents`). They are consistent across the core SDK packages (`deepagents`, `code`); run `make help` to see what a given package supports:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `make help` | List the package's available targets |
| `make test` | Run unit tests (no network; coverage output in packages that enable it) |
| `make test TEST_FILE=tests/unit_tests/test_foo.py` | Run a single test file |
| `make integration_test` | Run integration tests (network allowed) |
| `make lint` | Run `ruff` checks + `ty` type checking |
| `make format` | Auto-format and apply safe `ruff` fixes |
| `make type` | Run the `ty` type checker only |
| `make coverage` | Run the package's explicit coverage target, usually including XML output |

You can also run a specific test directly:

```bash
uv run --group test pytest tests/unit_tests/test_specific.py
```

### Repo-wide commands

Run these from `libs/` to fan out across packages:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `make lint` | Lint every package |
| `make format` | Format every package |
| `make lock` | Update all lockfiles |
| `make lock-check` | Verify all lockfiles are up to date |
| `make lock-bump DEP=<pkg>` | Bump one dependency across all lockfiles |

## Docstrings

Google-style, with an `Args` section, for every public function. The rules are in the root [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md#code-and-documentation); this is the shape they produce:

```python
def send_email(to: str, msg: str, *, priority: str = "normal") -> bool:
    """Send an email to a recipient with specified priority.

    Any additional context about the function can go here.

    Args:
        to: The email address of the recipient.
        msg: The message body to send.
        priority: Email priority level.

    Returns:
        `True` if email was sent successfully, `False` otherwise.

    Raises:
        InvalidEmailError: If the email address format is invalid.
        SMTPConnectionError: If unable to connect to email server.
    """
```

## Suppressing ruff rules

`per-file-ignores` silences a rule for the *entire* file. Add it for one violation and every future violation of that rule in that file is silently ignored. Inline `# noqa` is precise to the line, self-documenting, and keeps the safety net intact for the rest of the file. Justify every suppression in a comment. If you cannot justify it, the code is probably the problem.

Reserve `per-file-ignores` for categorical policy that applies to a whole class of files. Those are not exceptions; they are different rules for a different context.

```toml
# GOOD - categorical policy in pyproject.toml
[tool.ruff.lint.per-file-ignores]
"tests/**" = ["D1", "S101"]

# BAD - single-line exception buried in pyproject.toml
"deepagents_code/agent.py" = ["PLR2004"]
```

```python
# GOOD - precise, self-documenting inline suppression
timeout = 30  # noqa: PLR2004  # default HTTP timeout, not arbitrary
```

## Pre-commit hooks

The repo uses [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) for formatting, linting, lockfile checks, and Conventional Commit message validation:

```bash
uv tool install pre-commit   # or: pipx install pre-commit
pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

The hooks run `make format lint` for changed packages and validate commit messages, so most CI lint failures are caught before you push.

### Branch-name pre-push hook

The `pre-push` stage also runs a branch-name check (`.githooks/pre-push`, registered in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`) that rejects pushes of branches that don't follow the `<github-username>/<scope>/<short-description>` convention (e.g. `mdrxy/cli/startup-cmd-flag`). Because it runs through pre-commit, `pre-commit install --install-hooks` enables it — no separate `core.hooksPath` wiring, which would shadow the other installed hooks.

**If you installed the hooks before this check was added, re-run the install command.** `pre-commit` writes one hook file per type at install time, so an existing checkout has no `.git/hooks/pre-push` and gets no enforcement until you re-run:

```bash
pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

The hook resolves your GitHub login from `git config github.user`, falling back to `gh api user` and then the local part of `user.email`. The fallbacks are best-effort — setting it explicitly is the reliable option, and required if your commit email is a `users.noreply.github.com` or `first.last@` address that doesn't match your login:

```bash
git config github.user <your-github-login>
```

Protected branches (`main`, `master`, `vX.Y`), automation branches (`release-please--*`, `dependabot/*`, `copilot/*`) and release branches (`alpha/*`, `beta/*`, `rc/*`, `dev/*`) are always allowed, and pushing one needs no resolvable login at all — the hook only looks your username up when the branch it is checking is supposed to carry one.

The hook is a local convenience and can be skipped with `git push --no-verify` or `SKIP=branch-name git push`. Two cases it cannot catch, both consequences of running through pre-commit rather than as a raw git hook: pushing several refs at once validates only one of them, and pushing a branch that carries no new commits runs no hooks at all. `.github/workflows/branch_name_check.yml` covers both, as a non-blocking warning on the PR head branch — note that CI deliberately does not check the username segment against the PR author, so on that one point it is looser than the local hook.

## Testing

Test files mirror the source layout: tests for `deepagents/middleware/foo.py` live in `tests/unit_tests/middleware/test_foo.py`. Write tests against real behavior and avoid mocks where practical. When the conventions for a case are unclear, read the nearby existing tests first.

### Warnings fail the suite

Every package puts `"error"` first in its pytest `filterwarnings`. Any warning the repo has not explicitly accepted fails the run. The entries after `"error"` are the reviewed allowlist. Fix actionable warnings first and treat an allowlist entry as the last resort. The rules for writing a filter entry live in the root [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md#warnings-are-errors).

How a stray warning surfaces depends on when it is raised:

- Inside a test: that test fails.
- During module import: collection of that file fails.
- While pytest is still configuring (typically from a plugin): the run aborts with `INTERNALERROR`, which is the hardest to read from CI output. Warnings emitted while pytest loads plugins, before the ini filters are installed, are not caught at all — a clean run does not prove a dependency is warning-free.

#### `bypass-warnings-check` label

Maintainers can apply the `bypass-warnings-check` PR label and re-run failed jobs to demote warnings from errors. This is an escape hatch for landing fixes under time pressure, not a permanent fix: merge-queue runs enforce the policy again, so the warning must still be addressed or allowlisted. Two limits on its reach:

- It applies only to jobs that go through `_test.yml`. The `test-quickjs-sdk-smoke` job in `ci.yml` invokes pytest directly and has no bypass path.
- Release runs (`release.yml`) always enforce, so a warning that only appears against the built wheel cannot be labeled past.

## Benchmarks

Three packages carry benchmarks: `libs/deepagents`, `libs/code`, and `libs/partners/quickjs`. Each defines `bench` (walltime) and `bench-memory` (heap) Make targets. Other packages have no `bench` target, so `make -C libs/evals bench` fails.

These targets are the single source of truth for the benchmark invocation. Both local runs and the reusable CI workflow (`.github/workflows/_benchmark.yml`) call them. To change how benchmarks run, edit the Makefile; CI inherits the change.

```bash
# Single package (same target CI invokes):
make -C libs/deepagents bench

# `deepagents` and `code` in one go (BENCH_PACKAGES in libs/Makefile;
# note quickjs is not included):
make -C libs bench-all

# Plain pytest-benchmark without CodSpeed instrumentation — faster, for
# ad-hoc local tuning:
make -C libs/deepagents benchmark
```

`bench-memory` runs the `memory_benchmark`-marked subset. In CI it is gated behind the `has-memory-benchmarks` input on `_benchmark.yml`, which defaults to `false`. No caller sets it today, so memory benchmarks are effectively local-only; wire the flag in if you add one to the sweep.

Results land on the [CodSpeed dashboard](https://codspeed.io/langchain-ai/deepagents), with a separate view per package via the upper-left selector. Regression thresholds are managed in the dashboard, not in this repo, so a value quoted here will drift (10% global at the time of writing); tighten per-benchmark thresholds for benches whose noise floor is well below that, since a wide threshold masks real regressions in tight code.

`.github/workflows/_benchmark_nightly.yml` is the only caller of `_benchmark.yml`; there is no per-PR benchmark job. It runs on a daily cron over every package in its list, so baselines for unchanged packages do not drift. It covers `libs/deepagents` and `libs/code` only — `libs/partners/quickjs` defines benchmark targets but is not in the sweep. Use `workflow_dispatch` on that workflow for an ad-hoc run before bumping `pytest-codspeed` or the `CodSpeedHQ/action` SHA.

## Contributing conventions

Conventions live in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) at the repo root: Conventional Commits with a mandatory scope, branch naming, test requirements, and public-interface stability. Well-formed titles look like:

```txt
feat(sdk): add new chat completion feature
fix(sdk): resolve type hinting issue
chore(evals): update infrastructure dependencies
test(code): missing unit tests for `_git`
feat(code): `--startup-cmd` flag
style(code): strip trailing annotations from `ask_user` questions
```

External PRs must link an approved issue/discussion (see the contributing guide linked above), and the PR description fills in the repository template.

CI runs a number of gates beyond tests — Conventional Commit linting, lockfile freshness, version/extras consistency, and SDK-pin checks among them. Running `make format lint` in the package you changed and `make lock-check` from `libs/` clears the most common ones.
