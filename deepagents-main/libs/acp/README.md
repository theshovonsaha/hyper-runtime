# Deep Agents ACP integration

This directory contains an [Agent Client Protocol (ACP)](https://agentclientprotocol.com/overview/introduction) connector that allows you to run a Python [Deep Agent](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/deepagents/overview) within a text editor that supports ACP such as [Zed](https://zed.dev/).

![Deep Agents ACP Demo](./static/img/deepagentsacp.gif)

It includes an example coding agent that uses Anthropic's Claude models to write code with its built-in filesystem tools and shell, but you can also connect any Deep Agent with additional tools or different agent architectures!

> [!TIP]
> Want a ready-made coding agent instead of wiring up your own? The [`deepagents-code`](https://pypi.org/project/deepagents-code/) package (the `dcode` terminal coding agent) can expose its prebuilt coding agent as an ACP server with a single command — no custom agent code required. See [Use the prebuilt Deep Agents Code agent (`dcode --acp`)](#use-the-prebuilt-deep-agents-code-agent-dcode---acp) below. The rest of this guide covers running a bare/general Deep Agent, which does not include the `dcode` coding agent.

## Getting started

First, make sure you have [Zed](https://zed.dev/) and [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed.

Next, clone this repo:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:langchain-ai/deepagents.git
```

Then, navigate into the newly created folder and run `uv sync`:

```sh
cd deepagents/libs/acp
uv sync --group examples
```

Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and add your [Anthropic](https://claude.com/platform/api) API key. You may also optionally set up tracing for your Deep Agent using [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) by populating the other env vars in the example file:

```ini
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=""

# Set up LangSmith tracing for your Deep Agent (optional)

# LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
# LANGSMITH_API_KEY=""
# LANGSMITH_PROJECT="deepagents-acp"
```

Finally, add this to your Zed `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "DeepAgents": {
      "type": "custom",
      "command": "/your/absolute/path/to/deepagents-acp/run_demo_agent.sh"
    }
  }
}
```

You must also make sure that the `run_demo_agent.sh` entrypoint file is executable - this should be the case by default, but if you see permissions issues, run:

```sh
chmod +x run_demo_agent.sh
```

Now, open Zed's Agents Panel (e.g. with `CMD + Shift + ?`). You should see an option to create a new Deep Agent thread:

![](./static/img/newdeepagent.png)

And that's it! You can now use the Deep Agent in Zed to interact with your project.

If you need to upgrade your version of Deep Agents, pull the latest changes and re-sync:

```sh
git pull && uv sync --group examples
```

Or for specific packages:

```sh
uv lock --upgrade-package langchain_anthropic # for example
```

## Launch a custom Deep Agent with ACP

```sh
uv add deepagents-acp
```

```python
import asyncio

from acp import run_agent
from deepagents import create_deep_agent
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

from deepagents_acp.server import AgentServerACP


async def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get weather for a given city."""
    return f"It's always sunny in {city}!"


async def main() -> None:
    agent = create_deep_agent(
        tools=[get_weather],
        system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant",
        checkpointer=MemorySaver(),
    )
    server = AgentServerACP(agent)
    await run_agent(server)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Persist and load sessions

`AgentServerACP` can advertise and implement ACP's `session/load` capability when the
agent uses a durable LangGraph checkpointer:

```python
server = AgentServerACP(agent, load_sessions=True)
```

The checkpointer must remain available across agent-process restarts. An in-memory
checkpointer is suitable for tests but does not provide restart persistence. On load, the
adapter restores the LangGraph thread, verifies the original working directory, and replays
the conversation to the client through `session/update` before returning.

### Launch with Toad

```sh
uv tool install -U batrachian-toad --python 3.14

toad acp "python path/to/your_server.py" .
# or
toad acp "uv run python path/to/your_server.py" .
```

## Use the prebuilt Deep Agents Code agent (`dcode --acp`)

If you don't need a custom agent, [`deepagents-code`](https://pypi.org/project/deepagents-code/) — the `dcode` terminal coding agent — can run its prebuilt coding agent as an ACP server over stdio. This ships the full `dcode` coding agent (filesystem tools, shell, MCP support, and subagents), unlike the bare/general Deep Agent used elsewhere in this guide.

Install `deepagents-code` together with the ACP dependencies:

```sh
uv tool install -U deepagents-code --with deepagents-acp
```

Then point your ACP-compatible editor at `dcode --acp`. For Zed, add this to your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "Deep Agents Code": {
      "type": "custom",
      "command": "dcode",
      "args": ["--acp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Select a model by passing `--model` (in `provider:model-name` form) to the command:

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "Deep Agents Code": {
      "type": "custom",
      "command": "dcode",
      "args": ["--acp", "--model", "anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5"]
    }
  }
}
```

`dcode` reads provider API keys from the environment (e.g. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`), the same way it does in the terminal. Run `dcode --help` to see the other flags supported in ACP mode, such as `--mcp-config` and `--no-mcp`.

## Model Switching

The ACP adapter supports dynamic model switching using Session Config Options. This allows users to switch between different LLM models mid-session without losing conversation history.

### Quick Example

```python
from deepagents_acp.server import AgentServerACP, AgentSessionContext

# Define available models
models = [
    {"value": "anthropic:claude-opus-4-6", "name": "Claude Opus 4"},
    {"value": "anthropic:claude-sonnet-4", "name": "Claude Sonnet 4"},
    {"value": "openai:gpt-4-turbo", "name": "GPT-4 Turbo"},
]

# Create an agent factory that uses the model from context
def build_agent(context: AgentSessionContext):
    model = context.model

    # Pass model string directly - it handles provider:model-name format
    return create_deep_agent(
        model=model,
        checkpointer=checkpointer,
        backend=create_backend,
    )

# Pass models to the server
server = AgentServerACP(agent=build_agent, models=models)
```

You can see a full example [here](./examples/demo_agent.py) with LangChain's model profile feature.
