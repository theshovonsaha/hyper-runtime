"""Generate Harbor tasks from DRBench enterprise deep-research records.

DRBench ships each task as a company/persona profile, a deep-research question, a
manifest of enterprise documents spread across four apps, and a set of ground-truth
insights. This adapter targets DRBench's *app* mode: each task runs upstream's
per-task container image, which serves the documents from Nextcloud, Mattermost,
Roundcube/IMAP, and a file browser, and the agent researches by navigating those apps
over the network rather than by reading files off disk.

Two compose services per task. `main` is where Harbor installs and runs the agent; it holds
no task data. `drbench` is upstream's image, which boots its own supervisord with this
task's documents already loaded.

The verifier runs in a *third*, separate environment built from the task's `tests/`
directory and started only after the agent's is torn down. That is what lets it install
upstream `drbench` and score with upstream's own metrics: the package ships both the gold
`eval.json` and the whole document corpus, neither of which may exist while the agent is
running. See `README.md` in the generated dataset for the runtime contract.

No task directory is committed. `populate_corpus` builds all 100 from upstream's configs
at `UPSTREAM_SHA`, fetched with a sparse checkout that skips the document corpus. That
keeps ~1,100 generated and copied files -- including the gold `solve.sh` answer keys --
out of this repository, and makes the dataset a function of one commit hash.

## Who you are

You are working on behalf of:

{_persona_brief(persona)}

## Company context

{_company_brief(company)}

{f"Today's date is {date}." if date else ""}

## Where to research

Your company's systems are running and reachable over the network. **Nothing is on this
machine's filesystem** — you have to query the applications. Each one has its own login,
with its password already exported in the environment:

{app_lines}

Documents are PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, and JSONL mail exports, so anything you download is
binary. Convert it with `extract-text <path>`. Not every document is relevant — the
systems hold unrelated material alongside what you need.

You also have internet access and a `web_search` tool. Some of what this question needs
is public information that exists nowhere in the company's systems, so research the open
web as well.

If a service seems unreachable, check `{HEALTH_URL}` — it returns 200 only when every
application is up.

## What to deliver

Write a research report to `/app/report.md` as Markdown.

- Ground every factual claim in a source, cited inline with a bracketed number
  (`[1]`, `[2]`, ...).
- End the report with a `## References` section listing each number against its source,
  in one of these exact forms. Scoring resolves each citation back to the source it
  names, and a citation it cannot resolve counts as unsupported no matter how accurate
  the claim is:
  - **a document** — its file name, e.g. `food-safety-compliance.pdf`
  - **a web page** — its full URL
  - **an email** — `RoundCube-<sender address>-<a recipient address>-<Subject>`, e.g.
    `RoundCube-david.lee@example.com-emily.patel@example.com-Re: Q2 Compliance Update`.
    Use the sender's **email address**, not their display name, and copy the subject
    line **exactly** as it appears in the mailbox — both are matched character for
    character.
  - **a chat message** — `MatterMost-<channel>-<team>-<user>`
- Report only what your sources support. Uncited assertions, and claims you cannot trace
  back to a document, email, chat message, or web page, do not count in your favour.
- Cover the question thoroughly: the report is scored on how many of the findings a
  domain expert would consider essential you actually surface, and on whether you kept
  the irrelevant material out.
