# Deep Agents monorepo

Deep Agents is an opinionated, extensible agent harness built on LangChain and LangGraph. It packages the long-horizon features that a basic tool-calling agent does not provide by default: filesystem and shell backends, planning, context management, skills, persistent memory, human approval, and subagents. The root README is the product-level starting point; this wiki is the maintainer map.

## Start here

- Read [Architecture overview](architecture/overview.md) to trace `create_deep_agent()` from SDK construction into LangChain/LangGraph execution and to understand package boundaries.
- Read [Deep Agents Code](workflows/deep-agents-code.md) before changing the terminal agent, approval routing, auto mode, sandboxes, or MCP loading.
- Read [Evaluation and release](workflows/evaluation-and-release.md) before changing eval harnesses, Harbor workflows, score aggregation, or package-release automation.
- Use [Operations and testing](engineering/operations-and-testing.md) for the package-local edit/test/lint loop, CI controls, integrations, and source map.

## Repository shape

`libs/` is a set of independently versioned Python packages; there is deliberately no root `pyproject.toml`. Work inside the package being changed, where its `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `Makefile`, and tests define the local contract.

| Area | Role | First source anchor |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `libs/deepagents/` | Core SDK: `create_deep_agent`, middleware, profiles, backends, and subagent machinery. | `libs/deepagents/deepagents/graph.py` |
| `libs/code/` | `dcode` / Deep Agents Code terminal coding agent, with a Textual client and LangGraph server process. | `libs/code/deepagents_code/main.py` |
| `libs/acp/` | Agent Client Protocol adapter for compiled Deep Agent graphs and ACP-capable editors. | `libs/acp/deepagents_acp/server.py` |
| `libs/evals/` | Unit/live evaluation tooling, Harbor integrations, datasets, and scorecard documentation. | `libs/evals/README.md` |
| `libs/talon/` | Local runtime host for long-running agents. | `libs/talon/README.md` |
| `libs/partners/` | Sandbox/provider integrations: Daytona, Modal, QuickJS, Runloop, and Vercel. | `libs/partners/` |
| `.github/` | Reusable CI, Harbor evaluations, release, and repository policy automation. | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |
| `examples/` | Focused patterns and deployable-reference agents rather than a shared product runtime. | `examples/README.md` |

The core SDK in [Architecture overview](architecture/overview.md) supplies the harness that [Deep Agents Code](workflows/deep-agents-code.md) configures for interactive coding. That agent is exercised and compared through [Evaluation and release](workflows/evaluation-and-release.md); package checks and publishing rules live in [Operations and testing](engineering/operations-and-testing.md).

## Task routing

Use this table to reach the owning behavior and the smallest evidence-backed check without a repository-wide search. Package tests belong in the affected package; the workflow guard is runnable from the SDK `uv` environment.

## Fast local loop

Use `uv`; repository guidance explicitly disallows using `pip`, Poetry, or Conda for environment/dependency operations. Install dependencies within the affected package and use its Makefile as the command source of truth:

```bash
cd libs/deepagents
uv sync --all-groups
make test
make lint
```

The common package targets are `make test` (socket-restricted unit tests), `make integration_test` (network permitted), `make lint`, `make format`, and `make type`. From `libs/`, `make lint` and `make lock-check` fan out across packages. See [Operations and testing](engineering/operations-and-testing.md) for checks by subsystem and CI behavior.

## Product and security boundaries

- The SDK is a harness, not a new graph runtime: LangChain owns the agent loop and LangGraph owns state, checkpointing, streaming, and interrupts.
- Tool authority follows the configured backend and middleware. The root README's security model is **trust the LLM**: enforce containment at tool/sandbox boundaries rather than treating model intent as a security control.
- Deep Agents Code adds approval UX and policy, but approval is not containment. For untrusted repositories, use a remote sandbox; read [Deep Agents Code](workflows/deep-agents-code.md) before changing approval/MCP behavior.
- Real model/Harbor evaluations have separate credentials, costs, and semantics from unit tests; they are documented in [Evaluation and release](workflows/evaluation-and-release.md).

## Current repository context

Current HEAD is `19de73de163d2ca907fa4d9a44f2e19af635aa39` (`fix(code): render first streamed text immediately (#5761)`). The recorded wiki `gitHead` (`23b83ad50f63d241d0069a3dc426d43b211adf2e`) is unavailable in this shallow checkout, so Git cannot produce a commit range. The reachable commit message plus the current widget, adapter, and focused tests are the evidence for this update.

The dcode transcript now writes the first assistant-text fragment immediately rather than waiting for its 100 ms markdown flush interval. Later fragments remain coalesced to keep the Textual event loop responsive to input. The adapter drains buffered widget content as it exits, including non-cancellation mid-stream errors, so the UI does not silently truncate a reply. See [assistant response streaming](workflows/deep-agents-code.md#assistant-response-streaming) for the lifecycle and focused test.

Deep Agents Code exposes editable-install status as the always-present boolean `metadata["editable"]` in the stream configuration. It is derived from the same cached PEP 610 lookup as the existing `+editable` suffix in `metadata["lc_versions"]["deepagents-code"]`, allowing trace consumers to filter without parsing a version string. The metadata is propagated trace-wide, so scope-limited contract fields remain deliberately absent. See [trace metadata and editable-install attribution](workflows/deep-agents-code.md#trace-metadata-and-editable-install-attribution) for the lifecycle, extension boundary, and focused tests.

The OpenWiki workflow installs `openwiki@0.3.3` under Node.js 26, invokes `openwiki code --update --print` with LangSmith tracing disabled, and runs in the dedicated `openwiki` GitHub environment. Before creating an update PR, it restores its own workflow file and stages only `openwiki` and `AGENTS.md`. Those boundaries prevent a generated documentation run from committing a changed CI workflow; the focused workflow guard test currently asserts the dedicated environment. See [Operations and testing](engineering/operations-and-testing.md#generated-openwiki-maintenance) before changing that automation.

## Backlog

- **Talon runtime host** — `libs/talon/README.md`; deferred from this first pass because the core SDK, dcode, and evaluation/release pathways dominate current repository changes.
- **Partner implementations** — `libs/partners/{daytona,modal,quickjs,runloop,vercel}`; catalogued above but not individually documented because each is an integration package with its own boundary and should be expanded when modified.
- **Examples** — `examples/README.md`; examples are intentionally navigated from their own READMEs and were not duplicated into the maintainer wiki.
