## Overview

Releases are managed via release-please, which:

1. Analyzes commits made to `main`
2. Creates/updates a release PR [(example)](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/pull/1956) with automated changelog and version bumps
3. When said release PR is merged, triggers the release workflow for that merge commit, which creates both a GitHub and PyPI release

## How It Works

### Automatic Release PRs

When commits land on `main`, release-please analyzes them and, **per package**, either:

- Creates a new release PR
- Updates an existing release PR (with additional changes)
- Does nothing — commit types that don't trigger a version bump (e.g., `chore`, `refactor`, `ci`, `docs`, `style`, `test`, `hotfix`) won't create a release PR on their own. However, if a release PR already exists, release-please may still rebase/update it. See [Releasable Commit Types and Version Bumping](#releasable-commit-types-and-version-bumping) for which types trigger bumps.

Each package gets its own **draft** release PR on a branch named `release-please--branches--main--components--<package>`. Mark the PR as ready for review before merging.

### Triggering a Release

To release a package:

1. Merge one or more [releasable conventional commits](#releasable-commit-types-and-version-bumping) to `main`
2. Wait for the release-please action to create/update the release PR (can take a minute or two)
3. Review the generated changelog in the PR. The published GitHub release body is extracted from the merged package `CHANGELOG.md`, not from the release PR description.
   1. Follow the [curated release-notes workflow](#curated-release-notes) after moving the PR from draft to ready for review. This applies to every release-please managed package.
4. Merge the release PR after its required checks pass — this triggers the pre-release checks, PyPI publish, and GitHub release

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `deepagents-code` pins an exact `deepagents==` version in `libs/code/pyproject.toml`. Bump this pin as part of any PR that depends on new SDK functionality — don't defer it to release time. The pin should always reflect the minimum SDK version `deepagents-code` actually requires. If you intentionally need to ship a release PR with an older SDK pin, add the `release: skip sdk pin check` label before merging. See [Release Failed: Code SDK Pin Is Older Than SDK](#release-failed-code-sdk-pin-is-older-than-sdk) for recovery if a stale pin slips through.

### Curated Release Notes

This applies to **every** package release-please manages. The package under release is derived from the release PR's head branch, so a package added to [`release-please-config.json`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/blob/main/release-please-config.json) is covered with no workflow change.

Keep the release PR in draft while changes are still accumulating. When it is ready to release:

1. Mark the PR ready for review. `release-bot` will post a polished release-notes draft as a PR comment.
2. Edit the notes in that marked comment as needed (while keeping the version heading intact).
3. After reviewing & finalizing, comment `@release-bot apply`. The bot updates that package's `CHANGELOG.md` (e.g. `libs/code/CHANGELOG.md` for `deepagents-code`) and mirrors the notes to the PR body.
4. Merge normally after the `curated release notes` CI check passes.

Run `@release-bot draft` to regenerate the draft if the automatic run fails or new changes cause release-please to add changelog entries to the release PR. If release-please updates the PR after the notes were applied, the check will fail until you run `draft` and `apply` again.

Re-drafting rewrites the original notes comment in place, which GitHub does not surface in the timeline. So that a regenerated draft is not missed, the bot follows an in-place rewrite with a short comment linking back to the refreshed notes — one per re-draft. A first-time draft posts no such pointer, since a brand-new comment is already visible.

`@release-bot draft` accepts optional one-off editing instructions on the same line, for example `@release-bot draft emphasize the breaking SDK change`. The instruction is passed to the drafting model as guidance subordinate to its fixed editing rules, capped at 500 characters, and echoed in the posted draft comment so the prompt that produced a draft is auditable. Anything after a second `@` on the line is dropped. `@release-bot apply` takes no instructions — it republishes the stored draft verbatim, so text after `apply` is ignored.

During a fanout release each package gets its own release PR, and each needs its own `draft`/`apply`. Commands act only on the PR they are posted to.

The merged changelog is the source for the published GitHub release notes.

To ship without curated notes, add the `release: dangerously skip curated notes` label. That is the only way to skip the curated-notes merge gate — use it only when you intentionally want the generated changelog as-is, without maintainer polish.

#### Observing a `@release-bot` run

A `@release-bot` comment triggers the "📝 Curate release notes" workflow on the `issue_comment` event, not on the PR's head branch, so it does **not** appear as a PR status check. To watch it:

- Open the repo's **Actions** tab → select "📝 Curate release notes" in the left sidebar → select the run whose title matches your release PR.
- From the CLI: `gh run list --workflow=release_notes.yml --limit 5`, find the row whose title matches your release PR, then run `gh run view <run-id> --log`.

> [!NOTE]
> The workflow's concurrency group is per-PR with `cancel-in-progress: false`, so a second command posted while a run is in flight queues behind it instead of cancelling it.

#### One-time repository setup

The draft and apply jobs reuse the repository's GitHub App credentials to mint short-lived installation tokens. Keep `ORG_MEMBERSHIP_APP_CLIENT_ID` as a repository variable and `ORG_MEMBERSHIP_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` as a repository secret, and ensure the installed App grants read/write access to contents, issues, and pull requests. `ORG_MEMBERSHIP_APP_ID` is not used by this workflow.

Configure these repository-level Actions variables, which are also needed by jobs that do not use the release environment:

- `RELEASE_BOT_LOGIN`: the App bot login, `<app-slug>[bot]`
- `RELEASE_BOT_ID`: the numeric user ID for that bot login (this is not the GitHub App ID)

Find the App slug in its GitHub App settings URL, then look up both values with:

```bash
APP_SLUG=<app-slug>
gh api "users/${APP_SLUG}[bot]" --jq '{login, id}'
```

Create the `release-bot` environment without required reviewers or other approval rules, because approval would block automatic drafting. Add `RELEASE_BOT_MODEL` as an environment variable, using an explicit `provider:model` value with one of the supported providers and a model that supports JSON Schema structured output. The model must also accept an output-token limit of at least 32,768, since the helper requests that ceiling on every provider; a model whose own limit is lower rejects the request outright. Every current OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini model an operator would reasonably pick clears it — the exceptions are older small models. Add the matching provider's API key as an environment secret (only the configured provider's key is required). The workflow reads a fixed secret name per provider:

| `RELEASE_BOT_MODEL` provider | Environment secret name |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| `openai` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| `anthropic` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| `google_genai` | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` |

For `openai:…`, pick a Chat Completions model (for example `openai:gpt-5.5`). This helper only calls Chat Completions, so Responses-API-only models cannot be used.

A mismatched secret name resolves to an empty key and fails the draft run with "The selected release-note model API key is not configured."

For the check to actually gate merges, add the literal `curated release notes` workflow job name to `main`'s required status checks (repo settings). Without that required check, failures remain visible on the PR but do not prevent a stale or unapplied changelog from being merged. The job reports a passing status on non-release PRs, so requiring it does not block unrelated work.

### Releasable Commit Types and Version Bumping

A commit creates or updates a release PR for a package only when release-please assigns it to that package and its type bumps the version. The releasable types are listed below. All packages are currently pre-1.0, so the effective bumps are shifted down one level:

| Commit Type                    | Standard (≥ 1.0) | Pre-1.0 (current) | Example                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `fix:`                         | Patch (0.0.x)     | Patch (0.0.x)      | `fix(sdk): resolve config loading issue` |
| `perf:`                        | Patch (0.0.x)     | Patch (0.0.x)      | `perf(sdk): reduce graph compile time`   |
| `revert:`                      | Patch (0.0.x)     | Patch (0.0.x)      | `revert(sdk): undo config change`        |
| `feat:`                        | Minor (0.x.0)     | Patch (0.0.x)      | `feat(sdk): add new export command`      |
| `feat!:`                       | Major (x.0.0)     | Minor (0.x.0)      | `feat(sdk)!: redesign config format`     |

### Changelog Inclusion

Not every commit type lands in the generated changelog. The set is configured in [`release-please-config.json`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/blob/main/release-please-config.json) under `changelog-sections`:

| Commit Type | In Changelog? | Section                  |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| `feat`      | Yes           | Features                 |
| `fix`       | Yes           | Bug Fixes                |
| `perf`      | Yes           | Performance Improvements |
| `revert`    | Yes           | Reverted Changes         |
| `docs`      | No (hidden)   | —                        |
| `style`     | No (hidden)   | —                        |
| `chore`     | No (hidden)   | —                        |
| `refactor`  | No (hidden)   | —                        |
| `test`      | No (hidden)   | —                        |
| `ci`        | No (hidden)   | —                        |
| `hotfix`    | No (hidden)   | —                        |

Breaking changes are additionally surfaced under a `⚠ BREAKING CHANGES` section at the top of the release notes — see [Breaking Changes](#breaking-changes).

A few rules of thumb for picking a type that respects what *should* end up in user-facing notes:

- A change is **release-note-worthy** if a downstream user could observe it: new API, changed behavior, fixed bug, perceptible perf delta. Use `feat`, `fix`, or `perf`.
- Internal-only work (refactors, test-only changes, CI tweaks, dependency bumps with no behavior change, comment/docstring updates) belongs in a hidden type. These still trigger a release PR rebase if one is open, but never appear in the changelog.
- Don't smuggle user-visible changes into hidden types (e.g., a `chore:` that adds a feature). The change won't appear in release notes and users will be surprised by undocumented behavior.
- The release PR description is a preview/control surface generated by release-please. The published GitHub release body comes from the merged package `CHANGELOG.md`, with contributor shoutouts appended by `release.yml`.
- Use the bot-authored curated-notes comment and `apply` command rather than editing generated files directly. A later release-please run can regenerate both surfaces; reapply any curation after the PR syncs by running `draft` and then `apply` again.

## Commit Format

All commits must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format with types and scopes defined in [`.github/workflows/pr_lint.yml`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/blob/main/.github/workflows/pr_lint.yml). **Scope is required** — PRs without a scope will fail the title lint check.

```text
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Examples

```bash
fix(sdk): resolve type hinting issue
feat(sdk): add new chat completion feature
feat(sdk)!: redesign configuration format
```

### Breaking Changes

Mark a change as breaking using either form supported by Conventional Commits — both are recognized by release-please:

1. **Bang notation** — append `!` after the scope.

   ```text
   feat(sdk)!: redesign configuration format
   ```

2. **`BREAKING CHANGE:` footer** — include a footer (separated from the body by a blank line). The token must be uppercase; lowercase `breaking change:` is ignored. `BREAKING-CHANGE:` (hyphenated) is also accepted as a synonym.

   ```text
   feat(sdk)!: rename `Backend.read` to `Backend.fetch`

   BREAKING CHANGE: `Backend.read` has been removed. Callers must update to
   `Backend.fetch`, which returns a `FetchResult` instead of raw bytes.
   ```

The `!` alone is sufficient to trigger the version bump. The `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer is optional — it only changes what text appears under the `⚠ BREAKING CHANGES` heading in the changelog. Without the footer, that entry is just the commit subject; with it, the entry becomes your footer text (use this to spell out the migration). Combine both whenever the migration path isn't obvious from the subject alone — the `!` makes the breaking nature obvious in `git log` and PR titles, and the footer carries the migration instructions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All packages are pre-1.0, so a breaking change bumps the **minor** version, not the major (see [Releasable Commit Types and Version Bumping](#releasable-commit-types-and-version-bumping)). The change is still flagged as `⚠ BREAKING CHANGES` at the top of the release notes regardless of the resulting version bump.

PRs containing breaking changes should:

- Use the `!` form in the PR title so the squash commit (whose subject is the PR title) carries the marker. Release-please reads the merged commit message, not the PR body. Put the marker in the title.
- Spell out the migration path in the PR body: what broke, how to update calling code, what the equivalent new API looks like.
- Be reviewed against the [stable public interfaces](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/blob/main/CLAUDE.md#maintain-stable-public-interfaces) guidance in `CLAUDE.md` — the bar for breaking a public API is high, especially for the SDK.
- Avoid bundling unrelated changes. A breaking commit should isolate the breaking surface so the changelog entry is precise.

## Configuration Files

### `release-please-config.json`

Defines release-please behavior for each package.

### `.release-please-manifest.json`

Tracks the current version of each package. Automatically updated by release-please — **do not edit manually** except when adding a new release-please-managed package. Example (versions shown are illustrative; check the actual file for current values):

```json
{
  "libs/deepagents": "0.5.1",
  "libs/acp": "0.0.5",
  "libs/talon": "0.0.1",
  "libs/partners/daytona": "0.0.5",
  "libs/partners/modal": "0.0.3",
  "libs/partners/runloop": "0.0.4",
  "libs/partners/vercel": "0.0.1",
  "libs/partners/quickjs": "0.0.1"
}
```

### Adding a release-please-managed package

When adding a new managed package, add it to both `release-please-config.json` and `.release-please-manifest.json`. The manifest entry is the **latest released version baseline**, not the package's current source version.

User story: you are adding a first-party integration package, such as a new sandbox provider under `libs/partners/<provider>`, and the PR title is release-worthy (`feat(<scope>): ...`). The package source starts at `0.0.1`, and you want the first release PR for that package to publish `0.0.1`, not immediately bump to `0.0.2` before the package has ever shipped. In this case, set the new `.release-please-manifest.json` entry to `0.0.0` while keeping the package's own `pyproject.toml` and `_version.py` at `0.0.1`.

Do **not** add a new managed package to the manifest at `0.0.1` unless `0.0.1` has already been released outside release-please. If the new manifest baseline is `0.0.1`, release-please treats that as already released and opens the initial release PR for `0.0.2`. The `Release-please initial baseline check` workflow blocks PRs that add a new `0.0.1` managed package baseline.

## Release Workflow

### Detection Mechanism

The [release-please workflow (`.github/workflows/release-please.yml`)](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/blob/main/.github/workflows/release-please.yml) detects merged release PRs by checking two conditions on the merge commit:

1. The package's `CHANGELOG.md` was modified (e.g., `libs/deepagents/CHANGELOG.md` for the SDK)
2. The commit message matches the `release(<component>): <version>` pattern

Both must be true. release-please always satisfies both when merging a release PR — a manual `CHANGELOG.md` edit alone will not trigger a release.

### What Happens When You Merge a Release PR

Publishing starts immediately. Housekeeping on the *other* open release PRs happens afterwards, in the same workflow run:

1. **Your package publishes first.** `trigger-releases` fires as soon as the release commit is detected and never waits on anything else. It comments on the merged PR with a direct link to each package's release run — that link is where you watch the actual publish.
2. **The run waits for publishing to settle.** `guard-pending-release` polls until no merged release PR is still labeled `autorelease: pending`.
3. **Then the remaining release PRs are refreshed.** release-please updates shared files (notably `.release-please-manifest.json`) on the still-open release PRs, and `update-lockfiles` regenerates their lockfiles.

In the normal case you do not need to think about any of this. Step 3 is the only part that can be quietly skipped — if the other release PRs look stale afterwards, expand *If the other release PRs were not refreshed* below.

<details>
<summary><b>Why publishing never waits, and why the wait covers the whole repo</b></summary>

**Publishing goes first** so that a publish is never blocked behind housekeeping for some *other* package. Only step 3 is serialized (release-please mutates shared release branches, so two copies must not run at once); steps 1 and 2 are deliberately outside that serialization.

**Step 3 requires an explicit all-clear.** The guard has to positively report "nothing in flight" (`skip=false`) for release-please to run. If the guard crashes, times out, or is skipped, release-please does *not* run — an unknown state is treated as unsafe rather than assumed fine.

**The wait covers every pending release PR in the repo, not just the one you merged.** This looks over-broad but is required: release-please recomputes *all* components on every run, so any single component sitting between "version bumped" and "tag created" is enough to trigger a bootstrap downgrade — it sees no tag, concludes the package was never released, and proposes resetting it to `0.1.0` with the full history. Scoping the wait to your own PR would not be safe.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>If the other release PRs were not refreshed</b></summary>

Step 3 can be skipped in the situations below. Skipping it holds up only the refresh of the *other* open release PRs — with one exception: a red `release.yml` means that package did not publish and has to be re-dispatched.

| Situation | What you will see | What to do | When the refresh happens |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A publish is still in flight after 45 min | `release-please.yml` green, with a `deferred` step summary | Nothing, unless the publish is genuinely stuck — then clear the label per [Release PR Stuck with "autorelease: pending"](#release-pr-stuck-with-autorelease-pending-label) | Next push to `main` |
| A publish failed (yours, or a package left stuck earlier) | `release.yml` red; `release-please.yml` green, with a `deferred (release commit)` summary naming the failed run | Fix and re-dispatch the failed package release — this package has **not** published | Next push to `main`, once the failed release is recovered |
| GitHub's release state is unreadable | `release-please.yml` **red** at `guard-pending-release` | Re-run the job. It refuses to guess whether a publish is in flight rather than recompute against unverified state | When the re-run succeeds |
| You merged several release PRs at once | Some `release-please` jobs show as **cancelled** | Nothing — this is expected. Only one job may queue per concurrency group | Already done: the surviving (newest) run recomputes every component, covering the cancelled jobs' work |

</details>

### Lockfile Updates

When release-please creates or updates a release PR, the `update-lockfiles` job automatically regenerates `uv.lock` files since release-please updates `pyproject.toml` versions but doesn't regenerate lockfiles.

### Release Pipeline

The [release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml) runs when a release PR is merged:

1. **Setup** - Resolves package name to working directory
2. **Build** - Creates distribution package
3. **Release Notes** + **Pre-release Checks** - Run in parallel; release notes extracts the changelog, appends a collapsible package-scoped Git log (newest commit first, up to 100 commits, truncated further if the log grows large), collects contributor shoutouts, and adds a **Special thanks** section crediting the users who filed the issues the release's PRs closed; pre-release checks run tests against the built package
4. **Test PyPI** - Publishes to test.pypi.org for validation (after pre-release checks pass)
5. **Publish** - Publishes to PyPI (requires Test PyPI to succeed)
6. **Mark Release** - Creates a published GitHub release with the built artifacts; updates PR labels. For the SDK (`libs/deepagents`), we set it as the repository's `latest` (unless it's a pre-release).

### Release PR Labels

Release-please uses labels to track the state of release PRs:

| Label | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| `autorelease: pending` | Applied by release-please when it opens the release PR, and carried until the release is tagged. On a **merged** PR it means the release has not been tagged/published yet |
| `autorelease: tagged` | Release PR has been successfully tagged and released |

Because `skip-github-release: true` is set in the release-please config (we create releases via our own workflow instead of using the one built into release-please), our `release.yml` workflow must update these labels manually for state management! After successfully creating the GitHub release and tag, the `mark-release` job updates the label from `pending` to `tagged`.

This label transition signals to release-please that the merged PR has been fully processed, allowing it to create new release PRs for subsequent commits to `main`.

### CI guardrails around releases

These workflows guard releases. Each one explains a failed check you may see on a PR:

- **PR title lint** (`pr_lint.yml`) — enforces Conventional Commits with a mandatory scope on PR titles; its allowed types and scopes are the canonical list.
- **Release-please parse check** (`release_please_parse_check.yml`) — runs `@conventional-commits/parser` on the would-be squash-merge message (`<title> (#<num>)` + body) at PR time. Fails the check and posts a sticky comment with a paste-ready `BEGIN_COMMIT_OVERRIDE` block when the parser would reject the body, preventing silent changelog drops. The parser is exact-pinned and must stay in lock-step with the version release-please itself depends on, declared in its own `package.json` upstream in `googleapis/release-please`.
- **Fan-out guards** — one workflow per row; see [Multi-component fan-out](#multi-component-fan-out).
  - `release_please_scope_check.yml` — blocks a bump-worthy PR that touches real files in more than one managed component, or only lockfiles inside a managed package. Bypass label: `allow-lockfile-release`.
  - `pr_scope_file_check.yml` — checks the PR scope against the files touched. Bypass label: `allow-scope-mismatch`.
  - `release_fanout_bypass_warn.yml` — posts a loud sticky when either bypass label is applied.
  - `release_please_fanout_watch.yml` — post-merge safety net; comments on open release PRs whose package delta is lockfile-only.
- **Auto-labeling** — `pr_labeler.yml` (unified PR labeler: size, file, title, external/internal, contributor tier) and `pr_labeler_backfill.yml` (manual backfill on open PRs). These apply labels for triage only; they do not gate releases (the guard workflows above honor their own bypass labels). Issue labeling is not release-gated; see [`LAYOUT.md`](./LAYOUT.md).

## Manual Release

For hotfixes or exceptional cases, you can trigger a release manually. Use the `hotfix` commit type so as to not trigger a further PR update/version bump.

1. Go to **Actions** > `🚀 Package Release`
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Select the package to release
4. **Provide `version`**: the version you want to publish (e.g. `0.0.35`). The workflow checks that the code you selected has the same version.
5. **Provide `release-sha`**: the commit to publish. Usually this is the release-please PR's merge commit. Find it with `gh pr view <release-pr-number> --json mergeCommit --jq .mergeCommit.oid`. If a release failed before anything reached PyPI, you can also use the hotfix commit you merged afterward. See [Hotfix Protocol > Case A](#case-a--release-failed-before-pypi-publish) for that recovery flow.
6. (Optionally enable `dangerous-nonmain-release` for hotfix branches that are not `main`. When enabled, `release-sha` may be left empty and the workflow uses the branch's current commit.)

> [!WARNING]
> Manual releases should be rare. Prefer the normal release-please flow whenever possible. Use this workflow mainly for recovery, such as when the release workflow failed after the release PR was already merged!
>
> **Why `release-sha` matters:** it tells the workflow exactly which commit to build, test, publish, and tag. That keeps the PyPI package and the GitHub tag pointing at the same code. The workflow also checks that the selected commit declares the version you are releasing.

## Hotfix Protocol

Something went wrong with a release. This section tells you what to do.

The right answer depends on a single question: **is the broken version already on PyPI?**

- **No** -> [Case A](#case-a--release-failed-before-pypi-publish): the release workflow failed partway through. Nothing public, you have options.
- **Yes** -> [Case B](#case-b--bug-found-after-pypi-publish): the bad version is out there. You'll ship a new patch version.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The rule we have to maintain:** a version should mean one exact thing. If `mypackage==1.2.3` is on PyPI, then the GitHub tag for `mypackage==1.2.3` must point at the same code.
>
> PyPI does its part automatically: once a version is uploaded, you cannot upload different files for that same version. GitHub tags are easier to move by accident, so we have to be careful. Do not move or recreate a tag for a version that is already on PyPI. If a shipped release needs a fix, ship a new version.

> Why it matters: if PyPI and GitHub disagree, different users can install different code for the same version without knowing it. See [Why one version = one artifact](#why-one-version--one-artifact) at the end of this section.

### Case A — Release failed before PyPI publish

The release-please PR was merged, but the release workflow failed before publishing anything. PyPI does not have the package yet, and no GitHub release was created.

Because nothing was published, you still get to decide what eventually goes out as this version. The fix:

1. **Figure out why the release failed.** Look at the workflow run logs.
2. **Open a PR with the fix.** Use a `hotfix(<scope>): <description>` title so it doesn't trigger another release PR update. Merge it to `main`.
   - Important: leave `pyproject.toml`'s version exactly as the release-please PR set it. The hotfix should only fix the problem that broke the release.
3. **Manually re-dispatch the release workflow** ([Manual Release](#manual-release)). Pass `release-sha` = the SHA of your hotfix commit — the one that fixed the release *and* still declares the target version. Right after you merge it, that's the tip of `main`, but pin the explicit SHA rather than relying on `HEAD` (e.g. `gh pr view <hotfix-pr-number> --json mergeCommit --jq .mergeCommit.oid`), since `main` can advance if another PR lands first. The workflow checks out, builds, publishes, and tags that exact commit.
4. **Confirm the label swap.** The `mark-release` job swaps the original release-please PR's `autorelease: pending` label to `autorelease: tagged` — it finds the right PR via a fallback label search, even though `release-sha` points at the hotfix commit, not the release-please commit. Double-check the original release-please PR in GitHub after the workflow succeeds. If the label didn't swap, fix it by hand — see [Release PR Stuck with "autorelease: pending" Label](#release-pr-stuck-with-autorelease-pending-label).

> [!NOTE]
> The git tag for the version ends up on the hotfix commit, not on the earlier release-please commit. That is okay: the hotfix commit is the code that actually shipped.

### Case B — Bug found *after* PyPI publish

The version is published.

**Do not:**

- Re-run the manual release workflow against the same version (PyPI will reject it anyway).
- Delete and re-create the git tag.
- Open a PR titled something like `hotfix(sdk): bump _version.py` and try to push out a "corrected" version with the same number.

**Do this instead:**

1. Open a normal `fix(<scope>): <description>` PR with the fix. Merge it to `main`.
2. release-please will open (or update) the next release PR — something like `release(<package>): <next-patch>`. Merge it. The standard auto-release flow handles PyPI and the GitHub tag.
3. If the broken release is actively harmful (security hole, won't install, corrupts data), also [yank it from PyPI](#yanking-a-release). Yanking hides a version from default installs but keeps it findable for anyone who pinned it explicitly. You don't need to delete the GitHub tag — leaving it preserves an audit trail.

That's it. The new patch version has its own commit, tag, and wheel. The broken version stays exactly as it was when it shipped.

#### Why one version = one artifact

If the GitHub tag for `<version>` points at different code than the PyPI package for `<version>`, users get different software depending on how they install it:

- `pip install <pkg>==<version>` -> gets the PyPI wheel.
- `pip install git+https://.../<repo>@<pkg>==<version>` -> gets whatever's at the GitHub tag.
- `git checkout <pkg>==<version>` (vendored copies, distro packagers, security tools pinning by SHA) -> also gets the GitHub tag's code.

When these disagree, the same version can behave differently for different users. The workflow pinning and the "never re-release a version" rule are there to prevent that.

## Alpha / Beta / Pre-release Versions

release-please can maintain normal Python versions for us, but it cannot safely maintain Python pre-release versions on long-lived branches.

The problem is the difference between SemVer and Python's [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) version syntax. release-please's built-in prerelease strategy produces SemVer versions like `0.0.35-alpha.1`, but PyPI requires the PEP 440 form `0.0.35a1`. If we manually commit that PEP 440 version to `main` or a long-lived `vX.Y` branch, a later release-please PR may not be able to move every version file back to the final GA version. In particular, the `_version.py` updater only matches stable-looking `X.Y.Z` / `X.Y.Z-suffix` values, not values like `0.0.35a1` or `0.0.35rc1`. The next GA release PR could update `pyproject.toml` to `0.0.35` while leaving `_version.py` stuck at `0.0.35a1`.

For that reason, never commit PEP 440 pre-release version bumps to `main` or a long-lived `vX.Y` version branch. Keep those branches in the stable-version shape release-please can maintain, and use the throwaway branch flow below for alpha, beta, RC, or `.dev` artifacts.

### How to publish a pre-release

Every pre-release stage uses a **throwaway branch** + [manual release](#manual-release). This keeps `main`, the release-please manifest, and any pending release PR completely untouched.

Choose these values before starting:

| Placeholder | Meaning | Example |
| ----------- | ------- | ------- |
| `<BASE_BRANCH>` | The version line being released: normally `main`, or the relevant `vX.Y` branch when staging or maintaining a separate line | `v0.7` |
| `<PACKAGE>` | The PyPI package name | `deepagents` |
| `<PATH>` | The package directory from [Managed Packages](#managed-packages) | `libs/deepagents` |
| `<MODULE>` | The Python module directory shown in the package's `extra-files` entry in `release-please-config.json` | `deepagents` |
| `<SCOPE>` | The package's conventional-commit scope | `sdk` |
| `<VERSION>` | The exact PEP 440 version that will be published | `0.7.0b1` |
| `<VERSION_SLUG>` | `<VERSION>` with periods replaced by hyphens, used only in the branch name | `0-7-0b1` |
| `<STAGE>` | The branch prefix: `alpha` for `aN`, `beta` for `bN`, `rc` for `rcN`, or `dev` for `.devN` | `beta` |

Use the exact `<VERSION>` everywhere except the branch name. For example, beta `0.7.0b1` uses branch `beta/deepagents-0-7-0b1`, while alpha `0.7.0a1` uses `alpha/deepagents-0-7-0a1`.

> [!CAUTION]
> Dispatching the workflow publishes real artifacts to PyPI and GitHub; it is not a dry run. A coding agent must resolve and present all values above, prepare the version and lockfile changes, show the diff, and wait for explicit human approval before committing, pushing, or dispatching the workflow.

1. **Create a branch from the version line you are releasing:**

   ```bash
   git checkout <BASE_BRANCH> && git pull
   git checkout -b <STAGE>/<PACKAGE>-<VERSION_SLUG>
   ```

   If no `vX.Y` branch exists, use `main`. Confirm the next iteration number from existing `<PACKAGE>==*` tags and releases before choosing `<VERSION>`.

   For example, when staging `deepagents` `0.7.0` on `v0.7` while `main` still tracks `0.6.x`, branch from `v0.7`, not `main`, so the artifact contains the staged `0.7` work.

2. **Bump the version** in both package files to the exact `<VERSION>`:

   - `<PATH>/pyproject.toml` — `version = "<VERSION>"`
   - `<PATH>/<MODULE>/_version.py` — `__version__ = "<VERSION>"`

   Use the package's `extra-files` entry in `release-please-config.json` as the source of truth for these paths. The version must use [PEP 440 pre-release syntax](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#pre-releases), such as `0.7.0b1`, not SemVer syntax such as `0.7.0-beta.1`.

3. **Regenerate package lockfiles** if the package has a `uv.lock`. The pre-commit lock check compares the local package version in the lockfile, so every pre-release version bump needs the same lockfile refresh as a release-please PR.

   ```bash
   uv lock --directory <PATH> --python <PYTHON_VERSION>
   ```

   Use the package's required Python version for `<PYTHON_VERSION>`: `3.14` for `acp`, `3.12` for every other package. This mapping is the same one the lock check enforces — see `python_version` in `libs/Makefile` and `_python_version` in `.github/scripts/checks/check_lockfiles_pre_commit.py`. Locking with the wrong version will fail the pre-commit `lock-check`.

   For example, for the SDK:

   ```bash
   uv lock --directory libs/deepagents --python 3.12
   ```

4. **Commit and push:**

   ```bash
   git add <PATH>/pyproject.toml <PATH>/<MODULE>/_version.py <PATH>/uv.lock
   git commit -m "hotfix(<SCOPE>): <STAGE> release <VERSION>"
   git push -u origin <STAGE>/<PACKAGE>-<VERSION_SLUG>
   ```

   Omit `<PATH>/uv.lock` only when the package does not have one.

5. **Trigger the release workflow:**

   Before dispatching, verify that both committed version files and any lockfile contain the exact `<VERSION>`. The workflow's `version` input labels the run but does not control the version built from the branch, and `dangerous-nonmain-release` bypasses the normal version-to-commit validation.

   - Go to **Actions** > `🚀 Package Release` > **Run workflow**
   - Branch: `<STAGE>/<PACKAGE>-<VERSION_SLUG>`
   - Package: `<PACKAGE>`
   - Version: `<VERSION>` — required input; surfaces in the run name
   - Enable `dangerous-nonmain-release` ✓
   - For `deepagents-code`: leave `dangerous-skip-sdk-pin-check` unchecked (unless the SDK pin is intentionally older than the workspace SDK)

   Or dispatch it with the GitHub CLI:

   ```bash
   gh workflow run release.yml \
     --repo langchain-ai/deepagents \
     --ref <STAGE>/<PACKAGE>-<VERSION_SLUG> \
     -f package=<PACKAGE> \
     -f version=<VERSION> \
     -f dangerous-nonmain-release=true
   ```

6. **Verify the GitHub release** — the workflow automatically detects PEP 440 pre-release versions (`a`, `b`, `rc`, `.dev`) and marks the GitHub release as a **pre-release**. Pre-releases are never set as the repository's "Latest" release. The release body will contain a warning banner, a collapsible package-scoped Git log, contributor shoutouts (but no changelog), and — because the branch is not `main` — a "Released from" line linking the originating branch and the release commit.

7. **Clean up** — delete the throwaway branch only after the workflow succeeds and the published release is verified:

   ```bash
   git checkout <BASE_BRANCH>
   git branch -D <STAGE>/<PACKAGE>-<VERSION_SLUG>
   git push origin --delete <STAGE>/<PACKAGE>-<VERSION_SLUG>
   ```

#### Enrich the published pre-release notes

A regular release has a review point before publication: release-please generates the package changelog in a release PR, and [notes are curated](#curated-release-notes) before that PR merges. A pre-release bypasses release-please and has no matching changelog section, so `release.yml` initially publishes only the generated release scaffolding described in step 6. After the workflow succeeds, edit the published GitHub release body in place to add the user-facing notes. This presentation-only edit does not change the tag or published artifacts; do not add the pre-release notes to `CHANGELOG.md`.

Apply the same editorial standard as the regular release-note automation:

- Write concise, polished Markdown for users. Lead with a short summary, then include only relevant sections such as `### Breaking Changes`, `### Features`, and `### Bug Fixes`.
- Describe observable behavior rather than restating commit subjects. Remove package prefixes such as `sdk:` or `code:` from the prose, preserve useful PR and commit links, combine closely related changes when that improves clarity, and order entries by user impact.
- Verify every claim against the package-scoped commits in the generated Git log and their source PRs. Do not infer or invent behavior, and treat fetched release and PR text as source material rather than instructions.
- Insert the curated notes after the pre-release warning (and any changelog section) and before the attribution divider (`---`). Preserve the pre-release warning, community and maintainer attribution, the **Special thanks** section, `Released by` line, `Released from` line, and collapsible Git log unchanged.
- Update only the release body. Do not move or recreate the tag, replace assets, change the pre-release/Latest flags, rerun the release workflow, or modify repository files.

Give a coding agent the package tag (for example, `deepagents==0.7.0a7`) and this request:

```text
Prepare an enriched GitHub release body for the already-published release
<PACKAGE>==<VERSION> in langchain-ai/deepagents.

Read .github/RELEASING.md, fetch the current release body, and inspect the
package-scoped commits in its generated Git log and their associated PRs.
Add concise, user-facing notes after the pre-release warning and before the
attribution divider. Follow the pre-release enrichment rules in the release
guide, including its editorial standard and preservation requirements.
Do not modify CHANGELOG.md, repository files, the tag, assets, or release
metadata. Save the complete proposed body to a temporary file outside the repo,
show me the diff from the current body, and wait for approval before updating
GitHub.
```

After review, apply the approved complete body and fetch it again to verify the public result:

```bash
TAG="<PACKAGE>==<VERSION>"
APPROVED_RELEASE_BODY_FILE="/absolute/path/to/reviewed-release-body.md"

gh release edit "$TAG" \
  --repo langchain-ai/deepagents \
  --notes-file "$APPROVED_RELEASE_BODY_FILE"

gh release view "$TAG" \
  --repo langchain-ai/deepagents \
  --json url,isPrerelease,targetCommitish,body
```

Pass only `--notes-file` when editing. Flags such as `--tag`, `--target`, `--prerelease`, or `--latest` can change release metadata and are not part of note enrichment.

### Promoting a pre-release to GA

After validating the final pre-release stage, merge the pending release PR (e.g., `release(deepagents-code): 0.0.35`) as normal from `main` — release-please handles the GA version, changelog, and tag. No extra steps are needed.

If no release PR exists yet (e.g., no releasable commits since the last GA, which is rare), you can force one with a package-scoped `Release-As` override. Do **not** use an empty commit on `main`: release-please assigns commits to packages by the file paths they change, not by the commit scope string. A commit titled `chore(code): ...` is not enough on its own! It must also touch a file under `libs/code` so release-please knows the override belongs to `deepagents-code` (instead of another managed package).

For example, after making a real edit under `libs/code`:

```bash
git add libs/code/<changed-file>
git commit -m "chore(code): release 0.0.35" -m "Release-As: 0.0.35"
```

If there is no meaningful package-file edit to make, use the config-file form instead: temporarily add `"release-as": "0.0.35"` to the `libs/code` package entry in `release-please-config.json`:

```diff
 "libs/code": {
   "release-type": "python",
   "package-name": "deepagents-code",
   "component": "deepagents-code",
+  "release-as": "0.0.35",
   "bump-minor-pre-major": true,
   "bump-patch-for-minor-pre-major": true,
   "extra-files": [
     "pyproject.toml",
     "deepagents_code/_version.py"
   ],
   "changelog-path": "CHANGELOG.md"
 }
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a temporary override, not permanent configuration. Let release-please open the release PR, then remove the `release-as` line in a follow-up `hotfix(code): remove release-as override` PR (so the next release-please run does not keep forcing `0.0.35`).

### Multiple pre-release iterations

Increment the numeric suffix within a stage: `0.0.35a1`, `0.0.35a2`; `0.0.35b1`, `0.0.35b2`; or `0.0.35rc1`, `0.0.35rc2`. When advancing to a new stage, start that stage at `1`—for example, move from `0.0.35a3` to `0.0.35b1`, then to `0.0.35rc1`.

Every iteration follows the same throwaway-branch and manual-dispatch flow above, using the matching `alpha/`, `beta/`, `rc/`, or `dev/` branch prefix.

## Developing a new version line

Most version progression needs **no dedicated branches**. Keep developing on `main` and let release-please cut the next version — including minor bumps, since a `feat!:` / `BREAKING CHANGE:` bumps the minor pre-1.0 (see [Releasable Commit Types and Version Bumping](#releasable-commit-types-and-version-bumping)).

Reach for a dedicated branch only when you need to (often temporarily) *decouple* a version line from `main`:

| Scenario | Branch | release-please runs there? | Releases via |
| -------- | ------ | -------------------------- | ------------ |
| Normal progression (incl. minor bumps) | none — use `main` | yes (on `main`) | automatic (on release PR merge) |
| **Staging** the next line before cutover (e.g. work toward `0.7` while `main` stays `0.6.x`) | `vX.Y` integration branch | no | optional pre-release builds ([Alpha/Beta](#how-to-publish-a-pre-release)) |
| **Maintenance** of an old line after cutover (e.g. patch `0.6.x` after `main` moves to `0.7`) | `vX.Y` maintenance branch | no (not wired) | [Manual Release](#manual-release) + `dangerous-nonmain-release` |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Name the branch with a `v` prefix** — `v0.7`, `v0.6`, etc. A branch named `0.7` gets **no branch protection**.

Both `main` and `v[0-9].*` require a CI-passing PR (no direct pushes). The only difference is that `v[0-9].*` allows merge commits in order to facilitate syncing `main` -> `vX.Y` ([staging](#staging-branch-main-stays-on-the-current-line) step 2) and the **cutover** (admin bypass — see below). A version-line DRI with branch-rule bypass privileges may occasionally force-push a staging branch after rebasing it onto `main`, **but only when they intentionally own the history rewrite** and have verified the final `main..vX.Y` range contains only the branch's intended commits.

### TL;DR — staging the next line of work (e.g. `v0.7` while `main` stays `v0.6.x`)

1. **Branch:** create `v0.7` from `main`.
2. **Build `0.7`:** land net-new work via **squash PRs into `v0.7`** (same flow as `main`).
3. **Keep `v0.7` current with `main`:** default to a PR with **base `v0.7`, head `main`** and merge it with **"Create a merge commit"** (not squash!). Use a PR title like `chore(repo): sync main into v0.7`; do not use `release` as the scope because PR title lint reserves `release` for the type and disallows it as a scope. CI runs on the merged result; `main`'s commits arrive as shared history, so the cutover stays clean. If the staging branch is being actively maintained by a DRI with branch-rule bypass privileges who can safely rewrite it, rebasing `v0.7` onto `main` and force-pushing with lease is also acceptable; verify `git rev-list --left-right --count main...v0.7` reports `0 N` and that `git log --oneline --no-merges main..v0.7` lists only the intended version-line commits. Cherry-pick instead only if `v0.7` deliberately diverges from `main` (e.g. `v0.7` deleted or rewrote a module that `main` is still bug-fixing, so a full merge would keep dragging the old code back and re-conflict on every sync — cherry-pick just the fixes you still want).
4. **Cutover:** an admin merges `v0.7` onto `main` with `git merge --no-ff` under admin bypass. See [Cutover](#cutover-main-adopts-the-new-line).

### Staging branch (`main` stays on the current line)

1. Create `vX.Y` from `main`. Do feature work via **squash PRs into `vX.Y`** — same flow as `main`, so every change is CI-gated and reviewed. Each PR becomes one clean conventional commit on the branch.
2. **Pulling in `main` fixes:** keep `vX.Y` current with one of these two workflows:

   - **Default for shared branches: merge `main` into `vX.Y`.** Open a **merge PR from `main` -> `vX.Y`** and land it as a **merge commit (not squash)**. Do this periodically. It buys three things:
     - **Still CI-gated.** The PR runs CI on the *merged* result, so you test `vX.Y` against the latest `main` before it lands.
     - **Conflicts stay small.** They surface in each sync PR instead of piling up for the final cutover.
     - **Clean cutover.** The merge brings `main`'s commits in as **shared history** (same SHAs, not copies), so release-please does not see copied `main` commits as new version-line work.

     Use a merge commit **only** for these sync PRs.

   - **Controlled exception: rebase `vX.Y` onto `main`.** If the version-line DRI has branch-rule bypass privileges and intentionally owns rewriting the staging branch, they may rebase and force-push with lease instead of creating sync merge commits. This keeps the GitHub compare view at `0 behind, N ahead` and makes the final cutover easy to audit. If no authorized maintainer can bypass the non-fast-forward rule, use the merge-PR workflow instead. Before pushing, verify:

     ```bash
     git rev-list --left-right --count main...vX.Y  # expect: 0 N
     git log --oneline --no-merges main..vX.Y      # only intended version-line commits
     git log --oneline --merges main..vX.Y         # empty, unless intentional
     ```

     After that verification, merging `vX.Y` into `main` makes release-please parse only the commits in `main..vX.Y`. Do **not** use this workflow if other contributors are basing active work on the staging branch unless they know the branch will be rewritten.

   > [!TIP]
   > If `vX.Y` deliberately *diverges* from `main` (it removed or rewrote code that `main` keeps patching), a full sync re-surfaces the same conflict every time. In that case **cherry-pick only the fixes you want** instead. Avoid cherry-picking commits that already exist on `main`: cherry-picks get new SHAs, so release-please can treat them as new commits at cutover.
3. **Need an installable build?** Cut a pre-release (`0.7.0a1`, …) with the throwaway-branch flow in [How to publish a pre-release](#how-to-publish-a-pre-release). release-please is never involved and `main` is untouched.

### Cutover (`main` adopts the new line)

When the new line is ready to become `main`:

1. Confirm `vX.Y` `HEAD` is green.
2. **Merge `vX.Y` onto `main` preserving individual commits.** The cutover can't be a normal PR (a `vX.Y` -> `main` PR would squash the whole version branch into one commit and gut the changelog!), so an **admin** brings it over with a merge commit under bypass. If you've kept `vX.Y` synced (staging step 2), there's little left to reconcile here:

   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull
   git merge --no-ff vX.Y
   git push origin main
   ```

   release-please ignores the merge commit itself and itemizes each per-PR squash commit from `vX.Y` into the changelog(s).
3. After the merge, release-please reads the incoming commits and computes the next version. Compare it to the version you intend to cut:

   - **If they match, you're done.** The commits already justify the target (e.g. a `feat!:` / `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the line bumps the minor if pre-1.0).
   - **If release-please picks a lower version, force it.** The commits resolve to less than your target (e.g. a line of only `feat:`/`fix:` stays as a `PATCH` bump pre-1.0). Override release-please's choice in one of two ways:

     - **`Release-As` footer** — put the footer on a commit that touches the package's files. release-please reads the footer and pins that version for the next release PR:

       ```bash
       git commit -m "feat(sdk): release X.Y.Z" -m "Release-As: X.Y.Z"
       ```

     - **`release-as` config key** — set `"release-as": "X.Y.Z"` on the package's entry in [`release-please-config.json`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/blob/main/release-please-config.json). Same effect, but it lives in config rather than a commit message. It's a standing override, so **delete the key once the release PR is open!** — otherwise every later run keeps pinning that same version.

   > [!CAUTION]
   > Don't put the `Release-As` footer on an `--allow-empty` commit on `main` — an empty commit touches no package paths and triggers the [empty-commit fan-out](#empty-commit-fan-out) guard, opening a release PR for *every* package. That's why the footer goes on a commit that actually edits the package's files; the `release-as` config key sidesteps this since editing the config file is itself a non-empty change.

### Maintenance branch (patching the old line after cutover)

After `main` adopts the new line, cut a `vX.Y` branch from the **last release commit** of the old line (e.g. branch `v0.6` from the `release(deepagents): 0.6.N` merge commit). Branching from the release commit means the latest `0.6` tag is its ancestor, so version math stays on the `0.6.x` line.

- **Backport** fixes by landing them on `main` first, then cherry-picking onto `vX.Y` with the conventional-commit message intact.
- **Release** from the branch with [Manual Release](#manual-release) + `dangerous-nonmain-release` (its stated purpose is backports): bump the version files on the branch, then dispatch `🚀 Package Release` with that branch, package, version, and `dangerous-nonmain-release` ✓. It is usually rare to need to release old versions so these steps remain manual.

## Troubleshooting

### Why don't I see a release PR?

Check these common causes first:

- **The [release-please workflow](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/actions/workflows/release-please.yml) has not run yet.** Wait a minute or two after the PR merges to `main`, then check the `release-please` workflow run.
- **The merged commit uses a hidden type.** `chore`, `refactor`, `ci`, `docs`, `style`, `test`, and `hotfix` do not create release PRs on their own. See [Releasable Commit Types and Version Bumping](#releasable-commit-types-and-version-bumping).
- **The commit was not assigned to the package you expected.** release-please scopes commits by **changed file paths**, not just the Conventional Commit scope. For example, a `feat(code): ...` commit must touch files under `libs/code` to create or update the `deepagents-code` release PR.
- **An [existing draft release PR](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+author%3Aapp%2Fgithub-actions) was updated instead.** Each package has at most one active release PR, on a branch named `release-please--branches--main--components--<package>`.
- **A previous merged release PR [is still pending](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22autorelease%3A%20pending%22).** If a release PR still has `autorelease: pending` after the release workflow finished, see [Release PR Stuck with "autorelease: pending" Label](#release-pr-stuck-with-autorelease-pending-label).

### Empty commit fan-out

> [!CAUTION]
> Never push an empty commit (`git commit --allow-empty`) to `main`. release-please scopes commits to packages by the file paths they touch. An empty commit has no paths, so it falls back to bumping **every** package — producing a release PR for each managed component, not the one you intended.

This most commonly bites when someone tries to "fix up" a merged PR's changelog entry by pushing an empty commit with a corrected conventional-commit subject (e.g., adding a missing `!` for a breaking change). The corrected subject does land in `git log`, but release-please reads file paths, not commit subjects, when deciding scope.

The `guard-empty-commit` job in [`release-please.yml`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/blob/main/.github/workflows/release-please.yml) blocks this at CI time: any push to `main` whose `HEAD` commit changes zero files fails fast with a clear error before the release-please action runs.

There is one narrow exception for history repair: an empty merge commit titled `hotfix(repo): ...` may pass if each commit introduced by the merged branch touches files. This covers cases where the final file tree is intentionally unchanged, but preserving the individual commits matters. For example, release-please reads commit history to decide package scope, version bumps, and changelog entries, so restoring a lost `feat(sdk)!` commit with a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer can be necessary even when the files already match `main`.

**If you need to amend a release note for a commit that already merged**, see [Overriding a Merged Commit's Changelog Entry](#overriding-a-merged-commits-changelog-entry) below. Do not push empty commits to `main`.

**If a fan-out has already happened** (release PRs opened for packages you didn't change), revert the offending commit on `main`. release-please will reconcile the open release PRs on the next push that actually touches package files; PRs for unaffected packages can be closed manually.

### Lockfile churn fan-out

A subtler sibling of the empty-commit case. release-please scopes a commit to a package by the file *paths* it touches and has no notion of "this file is just a lockfile." When a bump-worthy commit (a `feat:`/`fix:` in one package) also regenerates the `uv.lock` of every package that depends on it, release-please attributes the bump-worthy commit to those dependents too and opens a release PR for each — even though their only change is a regenerated lockfile.

> [!NOTE]
> Closing such a stray release PR does **not** make it stay closed. release-please decides what to release by comparing each component's last-released SHA in `.release-please-manifest.json` against `main`; the unreleased lockfile commit is still there, so the PR is regenerated on the next run. The only ways to stop it are to release the package (merge the PR) or to remove the unreleased bump from `main` — see [Reverting a Merged-but-Unreleased PR](#reverting-a-merged-but-unreleased-pr).

**Avoid it** by landing lockfile regeneration in a separate `chore(deps):` commit/PR — `chore` is hidden and triggers no release, so only the package with real source changes is released.

The `release_please_scope_check.yml` workflow ([`.github/scripts/release/check_lockfile_release_scope.py`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/blob/main/.github/scripts/release/check_lockfile_release_scope.py)) catches this at PR time: when a bump-worthy PR changes only a lockfile inside a managed package, it posts a sticky comment naming the affected components and **fails the check**. Resolve it (route the lockfile churn through a `chore(deps):` commit), or — for an intentional lockfile-only release such as a leaf-package security bump — apply the `allow-lockfile-release` label to acknowledge the fan-out and let the PR pass. Applying the label posts a loud bypass warning that lists every touched component — bypassing does **not** stop release-please from opening those release PRs. For the failure to actually gate merges, add the check to the branch's required status checks (repo settings).

After merge, `release_please_fanout_watch.yml` is a safety net: if an open `release(<component>):` PR's package path only changed lockfiles on `main` since the last released SHA, it sticky-comments that release PR and fails an advisory check so the fan-out is noticed within minutes. Recovery still follows [Reverting a Merged-but-Unreleased PR](#reverting-a-merged-but-unreleased-pr).

### Multi-component fan-out

Lockfile-only is a special case of a more general rule: **one bump-worthy PR should touch real files in at most one release-please component.**

When a `feat`/`fix` (etc.) also edits non-lockfile files under other managed packages — commonly cross-package `pyproject.toml` lower-bound bumps that accompany a single-package feature — release-please opens a **separate release PR for every touched component**. That is usually not what the author intended.

**Canonical split:**

1. One feature/fix PR scoped to the single package that owns the user-facing change (`feat(code): ...`).
2. One `chore(deps): ...` PR for the cross-package dependency / lockfile churn (`chore` is hidden and does not open release PRs).

`release_please_scope_check.yml` blocks bump-worthy multi-component real-file PRs the same way it blocks lockfile-only fan-out (same sticky / `allow-lockfile-release` bypass). `pr_scope_file_check.yml` sticky copy also states this release-please consequence when title scope and package dirs disagree. See also [Lockfile churn fan-out](#lockfile-churn-fan-out).

### Releasing a new line ahead of its dependents

Local development installs sibling packages as editable path dependencies via `[tool.uv.sources]`, which hides whether published dependency ranges would resolve for real users installing from PyPI. The `📦 Check Release Dependencies` workflow closes that gap on `release(...)` PRs: it strips local sources and runs `uv pip compile --no-sources --universal --prerelease allow --all-extras` against PyPI for each changed release manifest, failing when the public install graph is unsatisfiable.

When cutting a new major/minor line of a core package, it is normal for the release PR to be red on this check even with correct metadata: the branch already opens sibling upper bounds and floors in-tree, but **already-published** dependents on PyPI still reject the new line until they cut their own releases. In that case:

1. **Lift sibling bounds in-tree first** (partner upper bounds, downstream floors, exact consumer pins) so follow-up releases are ready to cut.
2. **Publish the core package**, acknowledging the check with the `release-deps: acknowledged` label. The label soft-runs the check: resolution still executes and the PR keeps a sticky listing the follow-up releases the public graph needs — the label does **not** mean "deps resolved."
3. **Publish dependents immediately after**, in dependency order: partners whose published metadata caps the new line (these gate extras like `deepagents-code[daytona]`) → exact-pinned primary consumers (e.g. `deepagents-code`) → packages with floors on those consumers.

Use `release-deps: acknowledged` only for this coordinated release order. If the pins on the branch are wrong (not merely ahead of what siblings have published), fix the dependency metadata instead of acknowledging. The follow-up list on the sticky is generated from live PyPI metadata, so treat "green under ack" as "the listed packages still owe releases," never as an all-clear.

The follow-up sticky is independent of the label: a release PR that resolves cleanly still gets one whenever a sibling's *published* metadata caps the new line, because resolution only proves the changed package installs — not that its reverse-dependents still do. The sticky clears itself once nothing is outstanding. Packages listed under a "could not be determined" warning are neither confirmed clean nor confirmed to owe a release; re-run the job before treating that list as exhaustive.

#### What `release-deps: acknowledged` does to each check

The label means "the release dependencies were reviewed," never "they are resolved." It no longer skips any job — every check still runs and still reports, so the outstanding work stays on the PR:

| Check | Effect of the label |
| --- | --- |
| [`📦 Check Release Dependencies`](#releasing-a-new-line-ahead-of-its-dependents) | Resolves in report-only mode: the check goes green, and the sticky still lists the follow-up releases the public install graph needs. |
| `📦 Check Dependency Freshness` | No effect on whether it runs. It is advisory in all cases, and its comment stays on the PR. |
| `🔗 Check SDK Pin` | Clears the hard failure on a **prerelease** pin, recording that the pin was reviewed. Stale-pin behaviour is unchanged (advisory; `release.yml` enforces it at publish). |

Because the label stops the release-dependency check from *blocking* without stopping it from *reporting*, treat everything still on the PR after applying it as a to-do list for the release sequence.

### Overriding a Merged Commit's Changelog Entry

Append a `BEGIN_COMMIT_OVERRIDE` block (shown below) to the **merged PR's body** when release-please needs to use a different message than the actual squash-merge commit. release-please reads merged PR bodies on every run within its lookback window and uses the override in place of the original commit message — no history rewrite, no force-push.

Two situations call for this:

1. **Wrong type/scope inferred** — e.g. a `feat:` that should have been `refactor:` or `chore:`.
2. **Parser cannot read the commit body** — `@conventional-commits/parser` (which release-please uses) is grammar-strict and does not honor markdown code fences. Bodies containing function calls split across lines (`name(` followed by a newline), even inside ` ``` ` blocks, throw a parse error and the commit is silently dropped from the changelog. The pre-merge `release_please_parse_check.yml` check catches this before merge; if a commit slipped through, use the override to recover.

```txt
BEGIN_COMMIT_OVERRIDE
refactor(scope): corrected description
END_COMMIT_OVERRIDE
```

Notes:

- Place the block at the bottom of the PR body, after a horizontal rule.
- To produce multiple changelog entries from one PR, separate corrected messages by a **blank line** with each starting `type(scope):`, or wrap each in `BEGIN_NESTED_COMMIT`/`END_NESTED_COMMIT` markers — release-please's splitter requires one of these forms; a bare newline between messages is parsed as a single commit's body.
- Only effective with **squash merges**. release-please attaches the override to the squash commit by matching it to the PR's `merge_commit_sha`; for plain-merge or rebase-merge strategies the per-branch commits have no PR association and the override is ignored.
- Effect lands when release-please next syncs the open release PR (push to `main` or manual workflow dispatch). Verify the entry moved/disappeared in the corresponding `release(<component>): X.Y.Z` PR.
- Update via `gh pr edit <num> --body-file <file>` to avoid shell-escaping the multi-line body. (`gh api -f body=@<file>` does **not** work — `-f` writes the literal string `@<file>` rather than reading the file.)

### Reverting a Merged-but-Unreleased PR

When a PR has merged to `main` but its `release(<component>): X.Y.Z` PR has **not** yet shipped, the bad commit is sitting in the open release PR's changelog. Pick a path based on whether the change should appear in the eventual release notes. (For commits that already shipped, see [Yanking a Release](#yanking-a-release) instead — and ship a follow-up `revert:` patch via the standard flow.)

#### Path A — Hide and Revert (Quiet)

Use when the original commit is a mistake the changelog should not record (broken feature, accidental merge, scope/type mistake that escaped lint). Net effect: the open release PR rebases without the entry, and the version may be recomputed if no other releasable commits remain.

1. **Override the original PR's commit message to a hidden type (`chore`).** Append at the bottom of the merged PR's body, after a horizontal rule:

   ```txt
   ---

   BEGIN_COMMIT_OVERRIDE
   chore(<scope>): <short description of the original change>
   END_COMMIT_OVERRIDE
   ```

   The `<short description>` should describe the *original change*, not the override or revert — release-please uses this verbatim as the (now-hidden) commit message. Apply with `gh pr edit <num> --body-file body.md` or via the web interface — see the caveats in [Overriding a Merged Commit's Changelog Entry](#overriding-a-merged-commits-changelog-entry).

2. **Open a revert PR off `main`** titled `chore(<scope>): revert <original title>`. The `chore` type keeps the revert itself out of the changelog as well.

   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull
   git revert <merge_sha>
   ```

   (This repo squash-merges, so `<merge_sha>` is a single-parent commit — no `-m` flag needed.)

3. **Wait for release-please to rebase the open release PR** on the next push to `main` (or dispatch the workflow manually). Verify the entry has disappeared from the corresponding `release(<component>): X.Y.Z` PR's rendered body before merging it.

#### Path B — `revert:` with Audit Trail

Use when something measurable has already happened off `main` (downstream consumers tracking the SHA, internal pre-release builds, public discussion of the change). The release PR will list the same change *twice* — once under its original section (`Features`, `Bug Fixes`, etc.) and once under `Reverted Changes` — because `revert` is configured as a visible section in `release-please-config.json`. Trade-off: honest history at the cost of a duplicated entry in a version that never shipped externally.

1. **Open a revert PR off `main`** titled `revert(<scope>): "<original title>"` (Conventional Commits convention quotes the original subject). Body should reference the merge SHA being reverted.

   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull
   git revert <merge_sha>
   ```

   As in Path A, no `-m` flag — squash-merged commits are single-parent.

2. **Merge the revert PR.**

3. **Wait for release-please to rebase the open release PR** on the next push to `main` (or dispatch the workflow manually). Verify the corresponding `release(<component>): X.Y.Z` PR's rendered body now contains both the original entry and a `Reverted Changes` entry before merging it.

#### Don'ts

- **No force-push to `main`** — branch protection blocks it and would drop unrelated commits anyway.
- **No empty commits** to "fix up" the changelog — `guard-empty-commit` fails them, and even if it didn't, the empty fan-out would open release PRs for every package (see [Empty commit fan-out](#empty-commit-fan-out)).
- **Don't edit the release PR body to remove the entry directly** — release-please regenerates the body from merged-PR commits on every sync, so manual edits persist only until the next push to `main`. The override on the original PR is the durable mechanism.
- **Don't edit `.release-please-manifest.json`** — manifest edits only matter for [Yanking a Release](#yanking-a-release) (versions that already shipped).

### Yanking a Release

If you need to yank (retract) a release:

#### 1. Yank from PyPI

Using the PyPI web interface or a CLI tool.

#### 2. Delete GitHub Release/Tag (optional)

```bash
# Delete the GitHub release (<PACKAGE> = package name from Managed Packages table)
gh release delete "<PACKAGE>==<VERSION>" --yes

# Delete the git tag
git tag -d "<PACKAGE>==<VERSION>"
git push origin --delete "<PACKAGE>==<VERSION>"
```

#### 3. Fix the Manifest

Edit `.release-please-manifest.json` to the last good version for the affected package, and update the corresponding `pyproject.toml` and `_version.py` to match.

### Release PR Stuck with "autorelease: pending" Label

If a release PR shows `autorelease: pending` after the release workflow ran, the label update step may have failed — on the mainline path `mark-release` will be red. This can block release-please from creating new release PRs.

**To fix manually:**

```bash
# Find the PR number for the release commit (<PACKAGE> = package name from Managed Packages table)
gh pr list --state merged --search "release(<PACKAGE>)" --limit 5

# Update the label
gh pr edit <PR_NUMBER> --remove-label "autorelease: pending" --add-label "autorelease: tagged"
```

On the normal mainline publish path, a failed label swap fails `mark-release`
after the tag and GitHub release already exist. Treat the package release as
done and fix only the stuck label so later release-please maintenance can run.

### Release Notes Job Failed or GitHub Release Body Is Empty

The `release-notes` job builds the published GitHub release body from the package `CHANGELOG.md`, contributor shoutouts, and a collapsible package-scoped git log. It is intentionally fail-open: if the job fails or produces an empty body, the publish to PyPI and the GitHub tag still succeed. The release is real — do **not** re-dispatch the full publish workflow for the same version.

A failed notes job is surfaced in the `mark-release` job of the same workflow run: look for an `::error::` annotation ("Release notes job failed") and a job summary with a paste-ready rebuild command. Degraded bodies (built with warnings) are instead summarized by the `release-notes` job itself under "⚠️ Release notes built with warnings."

To rebuild and apply the release body manually:

1. **Check out the release commit locally.** Use the same SHA that was used for the release (visible in the workflow run's "Resolved release target" summary, or via `gh pr view <pr-number> --json mergeCommit --jq .mergeCommit.oid`).

   The clone must have **full history and all tags** — the script resolves the predecessor tag that bounds the git log, and CI does this with `fetch-depth: 0` and `fetch-tags: true`. On a tag-less clone, run `git fetch --tags` first; if the clone is also shallow (`git rev-parse --is-shallow-repository` reports `true`), additionally run `git fetch --unshallow`.

2. **Rebuild the body** with the shared script. Run it **from the repository root** (or pass `--repo-root`):

   ```bash
   python .github/scripts/release/build_release_notes.py \
     --package <PACKAGE> \
     --version <VERSION> \
     --sha <RELEASE_SHA> \
     --repo langchain-ai/deepagents \
     --actor <YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME> \
     --base-branch <BRANCH_RELEASED_FROM> \
     --out /tmp/release-body.md
   ```

   `--actor` supplies the `Released by:` line when the release commit has no merged PR to read the merger from. `--base-branch` is required to reproduce the `Released from <branch> at commit ...` provenance line — omit it and that line is silently absent, which matters most for the `vX.Y` and `alpha/*` releases this recovery path usually serves. Pass `--default-branch` too if the repository default is not `main`.

   Add `--offline` to skip GitHub API calls entirely (contributors *and* the releaser). The body will still include the changelog section and git log scaffolding. Note that a missing `gh` CLI is **not** equivalent: contributor collection yields nothing either way, but the releaser still falls back to `--actor`, so the `Released by:` line survives.

   Review the generated file before applying it. The script exits non-zero and prints an `::error::` line if the SHA does not resolve, the package directory is missing, or an unexpected git command fails. Most git failures are deliberately tolerated and downgraded to warnings so a degraded body still gets built, so a zero exit status is **not** by itself evidence the body is complete — read the warnings. They are printed as `::warning::` lines on stderr; any warning containing `INCOMPLETE` is listed first.

   The script detects the most common recovery mistake for you: if it finds no predecessor tag but the package `CHANGELOG.md` documents earlier releases, it warns that **the clone is probably missing tags**. Re-fetch and rebuild rather than publishing that body. `<summary>Git log for initial release</summary>` on a package that has shipped before is the same symptom seen from the other side.

3. **Apply the body** to the existing GitHub release:

   ```bash
   gh release edit "<PACKAGE>==<VERSION>" \
     --repo langchain-ai/deepagents \
     --notes-file /tmp/release-body.md
   ```

   Pass **only** `--notes-file`. Flags such as `--tag`, `--target`, `--prerelease`, or `--latest` can change release metadata and are not part of note recovery. See [Enrich the published pre-release notes](#enrich-the-published-pre-release-notes) for the same `gh release edit` pattern used in pre-release workflows.

4. **Verify** the result:

   ```bash
   gh release view "<PACKAGE>==<VERSION>" \
     --repo langchain-ai/deepagents \
     --json url,isPrerelease,targetCommitish,body
   ```

The source of truth for release notes is the merged package `CHANGELOG.md`. For `deepagents-code`, the curated release-notes workflow should already have applied the notes to `CHANGELOG.md` before the release PR merged; recovery here is about reconstructing the published GitHub body scaffolding (contributors, git log, size limits) when the CI notes job failed.

### Release Failed: Pre-release Checks

The `pre-release-checks` job runs after the package is built but before anything is published. If it fails, nothing reached PyPI or GitHub Releases, but the release PR is already merged. release-please will not retry on its own. This is **Case A** in the [Hotfix Protocol](#case-a--release-failed-before-pypi-publish).

**Steps:**

1. **Look at the workflow logs** to see why it failed. Pre-release checks run on every Python version allowed by the package's `requires-python`, install the built package in a clean environment, and run:
   - `python -c "import <pkg>"` — does the package even import?
   - `make test` — do the unit tests pass against the built wheel?
   - `make integration_test` (if defined) — do the integration tests pass?

   A failure on only one matrix leg usually indicates a version-specific dependency or compatibility problem rather than a broken wheel on every interpreter.

2. **Open a `hotfix(<scope>): <description>` PR with the fix.** Merge it to `main` on top of the release-please commit. **Leave `pyproject.toml`'s version exactly as the release-please PR set it.**

3. **Manually re-dispatch the release** ([Manual Release](#manual-release)). Pass:
   - `version` = the same version you were originally trying to release.
   - `release-sha` = `main` `HEAD` (the hotfix commit you just merged).

   The workflow will build, test, publish, and tag that commit.

4. **Confirm the label swap.** The `mark-release` job should change the original release-please PR from `autorelease: pending` to `autorelease: tagged`. If the swap didn't happen, fix it manually — see [Release PR Stuck with "autorelease: pending" Label](#release-pr-stuck-with-autorelease-pending-label).

> [!TIP]
> Pre-release checks run against the *built wheel*, not against your editable working copy. That means failures here often point at missing files in the wheel or undeclared dependencies — things that worked locally because they were sitting in your venv but didn't get packaged. If the failure is an import error rather than a test assertion, check the `packages` config in `pyproject.toml` and the declared dependencies first.

### Re-releasing a Version

PyPI does not allow re-uploading the same version. If a release failed partway:

1. If already on PyPI: bump the version and release again
2. If only on test PyPI: the workflow uses `skip-existing: true`, so re-running should work
3. If the GitHub release exists but PyPI publish failed (e.g., from a manual re-run): delete the release/tag and re-run the workflow

> [!NOTE]
> The Test PyPI step uses `skip-existing: true` so that **workflow re-runs** don't fail when the version was already uploaded on a previous attempt. The tradeoff: on re-runs the Test PyPI step is silently skipped rather than re-validated, so it no longer acts as an upload gate.

### Unexpected Commit Authors in Release PRs

When viewing a release-please PR on GitHub, you may see commits attributed to contributors who didn't directly push to that PR. For example:

```txt
johndoe and others added 3 commits 4 minutes ago
```

This is a **GitHub UI quirk** caused by force pushes/rebasing, not actual commits to the PR branch.

**What's happening:**

1. release-please rebases its branch onto the latest `main`
2. The PR branch now includes commits from `main` as parent commits
3. GitHub's UI shows all "new" commits that appeared after the force push, including rebased parents

**The actual PR commits** are only:

- The release commit (e.g., `release(deepagents): 0.5.1` or `release(deepagents-code): 0.1.61`)
- The lockfile update commit (e.g., `chore: update lockfiles`)

Other commits shown are just the base that the PR branch was rebased onto. This is normal behavior and doesn't indicate unauthorized access.

### Release Failed: Code SDK Pin Is Older Than SDK

If the release workflow fails at the "Verify package pins SDK at or ahead of workspace version" step with:

```txt
deepagents-code SDK pin is older than the workspace SDK version!
SDK version (libs/deepagents/pyproject.toml): 0.4.2
deepagents-code SDK pin (libs/code/pyproject.toml): 0.4.1
```

This means `deepagents-code`'s pinned `deepagents` dependency in `libs/code/pyproject.toml` is older than the current SDK version. This can happen when the SDK is released independently and the pin isn't updated before the `deepagents-code` release PR is merged. A pin ahead of the workspace SDK is allowed for intentional prerelease coordination.

If the older pin is intentional, add the `release: skip sdk pin check` label to the release PR before merging. The automatic release dispatch will pass `dangerous-skip-sdk-pin-check=true`, preserving the normal auto-release path while recording the bypass decision on the PR. Only use this when `deepagents-code` does not depend on SDK functionality newer than the pinned version.

**To fix after an unlabeled release PR already failed:**

1. **Hotfix the pin on `main`:**

   ```bash
   # Update the pin in libs/code/pyproject.toml
   # e.g., change deepagents==0.4.1 to deepagents==0.4.2
   cd libs/code && uv lock
   git add libs/code/pyproject.toml libs/code/uv.lock
   git commit -m "hotfix(code): bump SDK pin to <VERSION>"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Manually trigger the release** (the push to `main` won't re-trigger the release because the commit doesn't modify `libs/code/CHANGELOG.md`):
   - Go to **Actions** > `🚀 Package Release`
   - Click **Run workflow**
   - Select `main` branch and `deepagents-code` package

3. **Verify the `autorelease: pending` label was swapped.** The `mark-release` job will attempt to find the release PR by label and update it automatically, even on manual dispatch. If the label wasn't swapped (e.g., the job failed), fix it manually — see [Release PR Stuck with "autorelease: pending" Label](#release-pr-stuck-with-autorelease-pending-label). **If you skip this step, release-please will not create new release PRs.**

### Release Failed: Ripgrep Install

On release-sensitive paths, the ripgrep install itself runs with no timeout. This applies to the strict step in CI and to the `Install ripgrep` step in `release.yml`. The rg-gated tests must exercise the real binary, not the Python fallback; one of them checks symlink containment. An apt or mirror failure therefore fails the job even though the code is fine.

If the apt log shows a mirror or network error, add the `bypass-ripgrep-check` label to the release PR and re-run CI. With the label present:

- **In CI** (`_test.yml`): the strict install still runs, but a failure becomes a tolerated continue. The step then unwinds `dpkg` and probes for a usable `rg`. If one is present, the leg keeps full coverage. If not, `DEEPAGENTS_RIPGREP_EXPECTED` is left unset, so `require_ripgrep()` skips the gated tests on that leg instead of failing them. The run posts a sticky comment on the PR that records which legs ran without ripgrep.
- **At dispatch** (`release-please.yml`): the automatic release dispatch passes `dangerous-skip-ripgrep-check=true` to `release.yml`. The publish run's `Install ripgrep` step then tolerates the same apt failure. It applies the same `rg` probe, and when the binary really is missing it writes a "Published without ripgrep coverage" block to the run summary.

The label is honored only on release PRs — a `pull_request` with a `release-please--` branch or a `release(` title. `push`-to-`main` and merge-queue runs have no PR label to read, so they always enforce the strict install. The dispatch reads the label at merge time: remove it before merging and the publish run enforces the strict install again. Remove the label and re-run CI to restore full ripgrep coverage before you rely on the result.

### "Untagged, merged release PRs outstanding" Error

If release-please logs show:

```txt
⚠ There are untagged, merged release PRs outstanding - aborting
```

This means a release PR was merged but its merge commit doesn't have the expected tag. This can happen if:

- The release workflow failed and the tag was manually created on a different commit (e.g., a hotfix)
- Someone manually moved or recreated a tag

**To diagnose**, compare the tag's commit with the release PR's merge commit:

```bash
# Find what commit the tag points to (<PACKAGE> = package name from Managed Packages table)
git ls-remote --tags origin | grep "<PACKAGE>==<VERSION>"

# Find the release PR's merge commit
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json mergeCommit --jq '.mergeCommit.oid'
```

If these differ, release-please is confused.

**To fix**, move the tag and update the GitHub release:

```bash
# 1. Delete the remote tag (<PACKAGE> = package name from Managed Packages table)
git push origin :refs/tags/<PACKAGE>==<VERSION>

# 2. Delete local tag if it exists
git tag -d <PACKAGE>==<VERSION> 2>/dev/null || true

# 3. Create tag on the correct commit (the release PR's merge commit)
git tag <PACKAGE>==<VERSION> <MERGE_COMMIT_SHA>

# 4. Push the new tag
git push origin <PACKAGE>==<VERSION>

# 5. Update the GitHub release's target_commitish to match
#    (moving a tag doesn't update this field automatically)
gh api -X PATCH repos/langchain-ai/deepagents/releases/$(gh api repos/langchain-ai/deepagents/releases --jq '.[] | select(.tag_name == "<PACKAGE>==<VERSION>") | .id') \
  -f target_commitish=<MERGE_COMMIT_SHA>
```

After fixing, the next push to main should properly create new release PRs.

> [!NOTE]
> If the package was already published to PyPI and you need to re-run the workflow, it uses `skip-existing: true` on test PyPI, so it will succeed without re-uploading.
