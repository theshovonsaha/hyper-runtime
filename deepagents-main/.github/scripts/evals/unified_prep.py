"""Prep step for the unified multi-model Harbor evals orchestrator.

Parses a free-form comma-separated model CSV, validates it via models.py,
maps each category to its Harbor dataset, and emits a per-model flat matrix
(one entry per shard, spanning every category) to GITHUB_OUTPUT.

Pool sizing is derived by `derive_pool`, not clamped after the fact: given
`concurrency` (trials in flight per shard job), `max_parallel =
MAX_TASKS_PER_MODEL // concurrency` is the per-model concurrent-shard budget.
The inner parallelism divides that budget across compared branches, while
the outer parallelism bounds concurrent `(model, branch)` jobs. Both invariants
hold by construction:
  per model:  branches * concurrency * inner <= MAX_TASKS_PER_MODEL (40)
  global:     outer * inner <= MAX_RUNNERS (80)
`total_job_guard` separately caps the total post-pack job count (summed across
models and branches) against a fixed budget so an oversized selection fails
fast instead of launching a firehose.
