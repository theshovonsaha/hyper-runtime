"""Shard math for the Harbor evals workflow (`.github/workflows/harbor.yml`).

Two concerns, two consumers, one tested source of truth:

* `expand_matrix` — used by the `prep` job to cross-product the model matrix
    with the shard axis. Guards the result against GitHub Actions' hard 256-job
    matrix cap (a sharded `all` run is `len(models) * n_shards`).
* `select_shard_tasks` — used by the per-shard `harbor` run step to pick this
    shard's disjoint slice of the dataset. It reproduces the *include-glob +
    `n_tasks`* subset of Harbor's task-selection pipeline (`_filter_task_ids` in
    `harbor/models/job/config.py`, as of the pinned Harbor) so that a sharded run
    executes exactly the tasks an unsharded `include_tasks`/`n_tasks` run would
  — just split across runners. It intentionally does **not** model Harbor's
    `exclude_task_names` stage or its empty-include `ValueError` (the workflow
    exposes no `exclude_tasks` input and fail-fasts on an empty include match
    itself); see `select_shard_tasks` for the full divergence note.
* `task_display_name` — used by the run step to turn a Harbor manifest task id
    into the `org/name` string the shard filter and `--include-task-name` expect,
    delegating to the task id's own `get_name()` so every id variant resolves.

Run as a script, `main()` drives `expand_matrix` from env vars and writes the
matrix to `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` (mirroring `.github/scripts/evals/models.py`).

    `names` MUST be in the dataset's native manifest order (the order of

    time. This reproduces the *include-glob + `n_tasks`* subset of Harbor's
    `_filter_task_ids` (`harbor/models/job/config.py`, as of the pinned

        empty `include_globs` keeps everything,

        before sharding — NOT per shard),
    3. partition with `j % n_shards == shard_index`.

    Because the cap is applied to the native-order list before partitioning, the
    union of every shard's result equals exactly the task set an unsharded
    `include_tasks`/`n_tasks` run would execute. Do not sort `names`:
    Harbor's `--n-tasks` slices in native order, so sorting would select a
    different N.

    Two stages of `_filter_task_ids` are intentionally **not** reproduced, so
    keep this in sync if a maintainer wires the corresponding inputs into the

    * `exclude_task_names` — Harbor applies it between the include filter and
        the `n_tasks` cap. The workflow exposes no `exclude_tasks` input, so it
        is omitted. (Parity here is by construction, not test-enforced; a Harbor
        refactor that renames `_filter_task_ids` won't fail any test here.)
    * the empty-include `ValueError` — Harbor raises when an include glob
        matches nothing; this returns an empty selection instead. The run step
        fail-fasts on an empty include match before calling this, so the divergence
        is unreachable in the workflow.
