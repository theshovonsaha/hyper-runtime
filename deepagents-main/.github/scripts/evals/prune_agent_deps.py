"""Prune the Harbor LangGraph agent's provider deps to the active model.

The agent (`libs/evals/deepagents_harbor/langgraph_project/langgraph_agent.py`)
picks its chat model at runtime through `langchain.chat_models.init_chat_model`,
which lazily imports only the provider package matching the model spec's
`provider:` prefix. The committed `langgraph.json` therefore lists *every*
provider so a local `langgraph dev` can run any model — but a single CI job only
ever runs one model, and installing the other providers just slows the sandbox
env build.

This script rewrites a `langgraph.json` in place, dropping every provider
package except the one matching `HARBOR_MODEL`'s provider. Non-provider
dependencies (langchain core, the staged local packages, MCP adapters, etc.)
are always kept. It runs in CI against the ephemeral checkout
(`.github/workflows/harbor.yml`, from the `libs/evals` working directory); the
committed file is left untouched.

Usage:
    HARBOR_MODEL=fireworks:accounts/... \\
        python3 prune_agent_deps.py path/to/langgraph.json
