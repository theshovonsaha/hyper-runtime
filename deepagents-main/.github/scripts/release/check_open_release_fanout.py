"""Flag open release-please PRs whose unreleased package delta is lockfile-only.

Post-merge safety net for the pre-merge gates in
`release_please_scope_check.yml`. Even when a bump-worthy multi-package PR
slips through, this report surfaces open `release(<component>):` PRs whose
component path — relative to the last *released package version* in
`.release-please-manifest.json` — only changed lockfiles on `main`.

What counts as lockfile-only unreleased delta:
    For each managed package path, resolve the manifest version to the package
    release tag (e.g. `deepagents-acp==0.2.2`, matching `tag-separator` /
    `include-component-in-tag` in `release-please-config.json`), then take
    `git diff --name-only <tag> HEAD` restricted to that path. If the component
    has an open release-please PR and every changed path under the package is a
    lockfile name (`uv.lock`), the component is reported.

    Files that only exist because the open release PR rewrote version metadata
    on its branch are *not* considered here: the diff is against `main` at the
    checkout HEAD (post push), not against the release branch tip.

The script only *reports* offenders as JSON on stdout. The calling workflow
posts sticky comments / fails the advisory job.
