"""Build a production-shaped GitHub release body locally.

Reconstructs the same release body that the `release.yml` `release-notes`
job publishes, so a maintainer can rebuild and apply it manually when the CI
job fails or produces an empty body after a successful publish.

The script is intentionally self-contained (no external dependencies) so it
runs in any environment with Python 3.11+ and `git` available.

The `gh` CLI is optional, but a missing `gh` is *not* the same as
`--offline`: contributor collection yields nothing either way, but the
releaser still falls back to `--actor` (so the body keeps a
`Released by:` line), whereas `--offline` suppresses that line too.

Usage:
    python .github/scripts/release/build_release_notes.py \
        --package deepagents-code \
        --version 0.0.42 \
        --sha <release-sha> \
        --repo langchain-ai/deepagents \
        --out /tmp/release-body.md

Run from the repository root (or pass `--repo-root`) in a clone with full
history and tags; predecessor-tag resolution needs both.

    so two PRs closing the same issue cost one call. Bots are filtered by the
