// per package and updates it in place rather than opening a new one (see
// .github/RELEASING.md), so "days since opened" — the only staleness signal
// this workflow has — is meaningless for them by construction.
//
// When the exemption actually fires: release PRs open as drafts
// (`draft-pull-request: true` in release-please-config.json) and stay drafts
// for most of their life, and drafts go through the same warn/close schedule
// as every other PR — so this provenance check is their only protection, on

// expected whenever a release PR is still a draft past warningDays; a
// sustained 0 means no release PR is currently old enough to warn, not that
// the exemption is dead code.
//
// These labels do NOT gate the exemption — provenance does (see isReleasePr).
// They are only a drift signal, matched to tell "a genuine release PR whose
// provenance changed" apart from "a contributor PR that titled itself
// `release(x):`". Both are individually unreliable, which is why neither is
// load-bearing:
//   * `release` is this repo's own, derived from the `release(scope):` title
//     type via .github/scripts/labeling/pr-labeler-config.json (typeToLabel).
//     On release-please's own PRs it is applied by a `continue-on-error` step
//     in release-please.yml, so it can silently fail to appear.
//   * `autorelease: pending` is release-please-action's built-in label,
//     applied by release-please itself as part of opening the PR (a failure
//     there fails the action, unlike the `continue-on-error` step above). See
//     release-please.yml:330-333 for the authoritative description — the
//     label table in RELEASING.md describes only its post-merge meaning.
